# 🚨 URGENT: Wix Backend Deployment Checklist

## Current Issue

Your widget is failing with 404 errors because the backend functions are not deployed to your Wix site.

## ✅ Backend Functions to Deploy

### **Critical Functions (Deploy First)**

1. ✅ `http-wixConnection.jsw` - **REQUIRED** - Connection testing endpoint
2. ✅ `http-diveLogs.jsw` - Dive log management
3. ✅ `http-getUserMemory.jsw` - User memory retrieval
4. ✅ `http-saveToUserMemory.jsw` - Save user memory
5. ✅ `http-userMemory.jsw` - Main memory management

### **Additional Functions (Deploy for Full Functionality)**

6. ✅ `http-chat.jsw` - Chat functionality
7. ✅ `http-loadMemories.jsw` - Load memories
8. ✅ `http-getUserProfile.jsw` - User profile management
9. ✅ `http-testConnection.jsw` - Additional testing
10. ✅ `http-utils.jsw` - Utility functions

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Wix Backend

1. Open your Wix site: `https://www.deepfreediving.com`
2. Click **"Edit Site"**
3. Enable **"Dev Mode"**
4. Navigate to **"Backend"** folder

### Step 2: Upload Functions

1. Copy the content of each `.jsw` file from your project
2. Create new `.jsw` files in Wix backend with the same names
3. Paste the content into each file

### Step 3: Publish

1. Click **"Publish"** in Wix editor
2. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

After publishing, test the connection:

```bash
# Test basic connection
curl -X GET https://www.deepfreediving.com/_functions/wixConnection
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T...",
  "message": "Wix backend is connected and working",
  "services": {...}
}
```

## 🔍 Current Errors (Will be Fixed)

- ❌ `/_functions/wixConnection` → 404
- ❌ Backend connection tests failing
- ❌ Widget initialization failing

## ✅ After Deployment

These errors should disappear:

- ✅ Widget will connect successfully
- ✅ Dive journal will save data
- ✅ User memory will work
- ✅ Chat functionality will work

## 🚨 Critical Files

The most important file to deploy first is `http-wixConnection.jsw` - this will fix the immediate 404 errors you're seeing in the console.

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure all imports are correctly formatted
3. Verify the Wix collections exist
4. Check the publish process completed successfully
