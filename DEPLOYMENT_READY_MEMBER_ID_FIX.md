# 🚀 READY TO DEPLOY: Updated Wix Files for Real Member ID

## ✅ FILES UPDATED:

### 1. **wix-frontend-page-v2.js**

- ✅ Added `import wixData from 'wix-data'`
- ✅ Updated `loadUserData()` to query PrivateMembersData first
- ✅ Gets real member ID from data hooks: `memberData.currentMemberId`
- ✅ Falls back to wixUsers.currentUser if hooks fail
- ✅ Uses real member ID for all API calls

### 2. **wix-frontend-widget.js**

- ✅ Added `import wixData from 'wix-data'`
- ✅ Updated `loadUserData()` to query PrivateMembersData first
- ✅ Gets real member ID from data hooks: `memberData.currentMemberId`
- ✅ Falls back to wixUsers.currentUser if hooks fail
- ✅ Uses real member ID for all API calls

### 3. **wix-data-hooks-example.js** (Reference file)

- ✅ Contains the data hooks code to copy into your Wix `data.js` file

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

### Step 1: Update Wix Data Hooks

1. **Copy the data hooks** from `wix-data-hooks-example.js`
2. **Paste into your Wix `data.js` file** (the one Wix created for PrivateMembersData)
3. **Save and publish** the backend code

### Step 2: Update Wix Frontend Files

1. **Copy `wix-frontend-page-v2.js`** → Paste into your Wix page code
2. **Copy `wix-frontend-widget.js`** → Paste into your Wix widget code
3. **Save and publish** your Wix site

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Visit your site while logged in**
2. **Check browser console** for these messages:
   - `🔍 Querying PrivateMembersData to get real member ID...`
   - `✅ Got REAL member ID from data hooks: [your-actual-member-id]`
3. **Test dive journal** - logs should save under your real member ID
4. **Test chat** - should reference your actual dive logs

## 🔍 WHAT TO EXPECT:

### Before (Current Behavior):

- User ID: `wix-guest-1754552021685`
- Dive logs save under guest ID
- Chat can't access your dive logs

### After (Expected Behavior):

- User ID: `[your-actual-wix-member-id]` (from data hooks)
- Dive logs save under your real member ID
- Chat can access and reference your dive logs
- Personalized coaching based on your dive history

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you still see guest IDs:

1. **Check data hooks are deployed** and working
2. **Verify you're logged into Wix** when testing
3. **Check browser console** for hook query results
4. **Ensure PrivateMembersData collection** has data hooks enabled

## 📞 SUCCESS INDICATORS:

✅ Console shows real member ID instead of `wix-guest-*`
✅ Dive logs save successfully
✅ Chat references recent dives (e.g., "your 112m dive at Honaunau bay")
✅ No more 404 errors from backend calls

You're now ready to deploy! This should finally solve the guest user ID issue and enable proper dive log tracking and personalized coaching.
