Generated: 2025-08-15T10:18:58.298Z

## IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSES:

### 1. DIVE LOGS DISAPPEARING ON RELOAD
**Issue**: Data only saved to localStorage, not persisting to Wix
**Root Cause**: Frontend may not be calling Wix save function after local save
**Solution**: Ensure every localStorage save triggers Wix persistence

### 2. IMAGE ANALYSIS FAILURES  
**Issue**: Vision API errors not gracefully handled
**Root Cause**: Insufficient error handling in OpenAI vision processing
**Solution**: Add robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. SECOND IMAGE UPLOAD NOT WORKING
**Issue**: UI state management during multiple uploads
**Root Cause**: Frontend event handlers may not reset properly
**Solution**: Improve file input state management and upload queue

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. **Deploy Wix backend functions** - Ensure all .jsw files are deployed to Wix
2. **Fix frontend data flow** - Ensure localStorage saves trigger Wix saves
3. **Improve error handling** - Add graceful degradation for API failures
4. **Test multiple image uploads** - Fix UI state management
5. **Monitor CORS** - Ensure cross-origin requests work properly

## NEXT STEPS:

1. Deploy and verify Wix backend functions are live
2. Test actual image uploads with real files
3. Monitor browser console during real user interactions
4. Implement comprehensive error logging
