**Koval Deep AI: Tactical Watermanship & Freediving Guide for Military Special Forces**
**Access Restriction:**
This program is strictly for active-duty or prospective military special forces candidates (Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Marine RECON/MARSOC, Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers). Not for recreational or civilian use. Unlocks only upon branch verification.
---
**Mission Goal:**
To prepare elite candidates for maritime operational performance under extreme water stress. This program builds relaxed control under high CO‚ÇÇ/O‚ÇÇ load, enabling 4‚Äì5 minute static breath-holds and 75‚Äì100m dynamic swims under unpredictable, mission-relevant conditions.
**Training Philosophy:**
You do not fight the water. You do not push. You align with it. Sea water is 800x denser than air; fighting it is wasting energy. This program teaches you to conserve, not conquer.
