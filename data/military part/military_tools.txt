## 🛠 MILITARY-ONLY TOOL LOGIC – Koval Deep AI Tactical Waterman System
This logic module is designed exclusively for **military personnel** preparing for combat water operations. It uses specialized freediving-based tools adapted from Level 1 & 2 training to develop **water comfort, CO₂ tolerance, underwater focus, and full combat utility**.
All tools must follow freediving core principles: proper breath control, structured progression, and strict safety supervision. These tools are designed to increase **real-world confidence**, **comfort under gear**, and **reliable underwater problem-solving**, while also **maintaining performance under stress**.

### 🔧 TOOL 1: CO₂ Tolerance Table Protocol
**Purpose:** Build respiratory strength, mental control, and CO₂ resistance through structured static breath-hold training.
* Perform 1 full CO₂ tolerance table, **8 breath-hold reps per session**
* Tables must be adjusted by certification level:
* **Level 1** = Low to Moderate Intensity Table
* **Level 2** = Moderate to High Intensity Table
* **Level 3** = High Intensity Table (short rest, long holds)
* Diver must complete all 8 reps before stopping
* After completion, diver must **report subjective difficulty**: “Too Easy / Manageable / Too Hard”
* Based on report, tool will adapt next session’s rest times or static durations
**Important:** CO₂ tables are meant to be difficult. Think of them like a full-body workout — discomfort builds tolerance.
---
### 🔧 TOOL 2: Tactical Bobs (Gear-Off Recomposition)
**Purpose:** Build high-stress comfort by simulating worst-case underwater gear loss and recomposition.
* Start with full equipment (mask, fins, weight belt)
* Descend (5–10 feet), **remove all gear underwater**, resurface, dive again, **re-don all gear underwater**
* Repeat **3–10 reps**, increasing weekly (e.g., Week 1 = 3 reps, Week 2 = 5 reps…)
* All motions must be smooth, efficient, and panic-free
---
### 🔧 TOOL 3: Mask Flood + Knot-Tying Statics (Dry Land CO₂ Drill)
**Purpose:** Train calm, functional apnea under high CO₂ stress while performing fine motor tasks blindfolded.
* Flood mask on land, start 2–3 minute static hold (based on CO₂ table progress)
* While holding breath, complete **assigned knots list** (see below)
* May not remove mask or breathe until all knots are completed
✅ Core Knots for Navy SEAL Candidates:
1. Bowline
2. Square Knot
3. Clove Hitch
4. Figure Eight + Follow-Through
5. Double Fisherman’s
6. Sheet Bend
7. Water Knot
8. Prusik Knot
9. Two Half Hitches
10. Taut-Line Hitch
---
### 🔧 TOOL 4: Feet-Bound Dolphin Kick Drills (25–50m)
**Purpose:** Train body positioning, propulsion under stress, and tactical water movement.
* Hands behind back or by side (military float position)
* Feet bound by rubber strap or soft zip tie
* Swim 25m–50m with dolphin kick only
* Focus: streamline, rhythm, calmness despite physical restriction
---
### 🔧 TOOL 5: Passive Float – Weighted Variants (No Wetsuit)
**Purpose:** Build vertical comfort, endurance, and stress response in surface survival situations.
* Float without wetsuit for 3–5 minutes
* Increase intensity by adding 2–4 lbs on a belt
* Diver must use **minimal motion** (eggbeater or scull) to remain afloat
* DO NOT increase float time — only increase difficulty through **weight/resistance**
---
### 🔫 BONUS TOOL: **Spearfishing for Tactical Confidence**
**Purpose:** Real-world diving practice to improve breath control, focus, and underwater movement.
* Candidates should spearfish weekly if possible, using correct freediving technique
* Must follow all **Level 1–2 protocols**: proper breath-up, exhale descent, recovery breathing, buddy safety
* Use sessions to practice sink phase entry, relaxation, and real-world task stress (targeting, holding)
---
## ⚠️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS
* All underwater drills must be supervised
* Never combine max attempts with CO₂ tables
* Warm-ups must trigger MDR without fatigue (NPDs, facial immersion, etc.)
* No Wim Hof, hyperventilation, or box breathing allowed
---
## 🎯 SYSTEM GOAL:
Prepare military candidates to:
* Handle combat water stress
* Maintain calm and function during gear loss/failure
* Build to 5:00+ static capacity
* Operate confidently during drownproofing, retrieval, and amphibious entry/exit ops
Let the water become your environment — not your enemy.
