## 🛠 MILITARY-ONLY TOOL LOGIC – Koval Deep AI Tactical Waterman System
This logic module is designed exclusively for **military personnel** preparing for combat water operations. It uses specialized freediving-based tools adapted from Level 1 & 2 training to develop **water comfort, CO₂ tolerance, underwater focus, and full combat utility**.
All tools must follow freediving core principles: proper breath control, structured progression, and strict safety supervision. These tools are designed to increase **real-world confidence**, **comfort under gear**, and **reliable underwater problem-solving**, while also **maintaining performance under stress**.

## 🔍 TOOL PRESCRIPTION MATRIX – Logic Filters
The following logic governs tool selection and progression:
### 1. `user_type` (SEAL Prep, Rescue Swimmer, SWCC, etc.)
* **SEAL Prep** → Assign Tactical Bobs, Passive Floats, Feet-Bound Dolphin Drills
* **Rescue Swimmer** → Prioritize Mask Floods + Weighted Floats
* **SWCC / Amphibious Units** → Emphasize gear-on descents, gear management under load
### 2. `freediving_certification_level` (1–3)
* **Level 1** → Tools 1, 2, 3 (Beginner protocols, longer recovery)
* **Level 2** → Tools 1–4 (Intermediate protocols, harder tables, gear drills)
* **Level 3** → Tools 1–5 + Spearfishing Integration (Advanced drills, minimal recovery)
### 3. `swim_confidence_level`
* **1–4** → Start with Tool 1 + 3 only (high supervision)
* **5–7** → Add Tool 2 (Tactical Bobs)
* **8–10** → Full tool access (1–5 + Bonus)
### 4. `static_apnea_pb`
* **<2:00** → Only low-intensity CO₂ table (Table A)
* **2:00–4:00** → Moderate table (Table B)
* **>4:00** → High-intensity static (Table C) and gear drills combined
### 5. `CO2_tolerance_level`
* **Low** → Focus Tools 1, 3, 5 (CO₂ Table, Mask-Knot Statics, Passive Float)
* **Moderate** → Add Tool 2 (Gear-Off Bobs) and Spearfishing
* **High** → Full combo plans with minimal rest + integrated static tasks
### 6. `last_drownproofing_attempt`
* **Never Attempted** → Begin with Tool 5 (Weighted Float Hold)
* **Attempted <1 month ago** → Review and retest after full tool cycle
* **Failed due to panic** → Add Tool 3 + reduced tool complexity
### 7. `panic_underwater`
* **Yes** → Begin with Mask Knot Statics + Controlled Tactical Bobs
* **No** → Access to gear-removal bobs and weighted floats
### 8. `fitness_level`
* **Beginner** → 2–3 tools max per week, static + dry tools
* **Intermediate** → Add 1–2 gear or water-based tools weekly
* **Elite** → Full tool stack, weekly challenge drills, reduced surface rest
### 9. `goal`
* **Complete Drownproofing** → Tools 1, 2, 4, 5 (weekly rotation)
* **Improve Dolphin Kick** → Tool 4 focus with static warm-up and sink drills
* **Blackout Resistance** → Tool 1 + 3 only, max 1 contraction under supervision
### 10. `availability_per_week`
* **1–2 sessions** → Only 1–2 tools (focus on high-value: CO₂ table + Tactical Bob)
* **3–4 sessions** → Add 1 gear drill + passive float
* **5–7 sessions** → Full progression cycle, one day off, one static-only day

### 🔧 TOOL 1: CO₂ Tolerance Table Protocol
**Purpose:** Build respiratory strength, mental control, and CO₂ resistance through structured static breath-hold training.
* Perform 1 full CO₂ tolerance table, **8 breath-hold reps per session**
* Tables must be adjusted by certification level:
* **Level 1** = Low to Moderate Intensity Table
* **Level 2** = Moderate to High Intensity Table
* **Level 3** = High Intensity Table (short rest, long holds)
* Diver must complete all 8 reps before stopping
* After completion, diver must **report subjective difficulty**: “Too Easy / Manageable / Too Hard”
**Important:** CO₂ tables are meant to be difficult. Think of them like a full-body workout — discomfort builds tolerance.
---
### 🔧 TOOL 2: Tactical Bobs (Gear-Off Recomposition)
**Purpose:** Build high-stress comfort by simulating worst-case underwater gear loss and recomposition.
* Start with full equipment (mask, fins, weight belt)
* Descend (5–10 feet), **remove all gear underwater**, resurface, dive again, **re-don all gear underwater**
* Repeat **3–10 reps**, increasing weekly
---
### 🔧 TOOL 3: Mask Flood + Knot-Tying Statics (Dry Land CO₂ Drill)
**Purpose:** Train calm, functional apnea under high CO₂ stress while performing fine motor tasks blindfolded.
* Flood mask on land, start 2–3 minute static hold (based on CO₂ table progress)
* While holding breath, complete **assigned knots list**
* May not remove mask or breathe until all knots are completed
✅ Core Knots:
1. Bowline
2. Square Knot
3. Clove Hitch
4. Figure Eight + Follow-Through
5. Double Fisherman’s
6. Sheet Bend
7. Water Knot
8. Prusik Knot
9. Two Half Hitches
10. Taut-Line Hitch
---
### 🔧 TOOL 4: Feet-Bound Dolphin Kick Drills (25–50m)
**Purpose:** Train body positioning, propulsion under stress, and tactical water movement.
* Feet bound by strap or soft tie
* Swim 25m–50m dolphin kick only
* Focus: streamline, rhythm, breath efficiency
---
### 🔧 TOOL 5: Passive Float – Weighted Variants (No Wetsuit)
**Purpose:** Build vertical comfort, endurance, and stress response.
* Float without wetsuit for 3–5 minutes
* Increase difficulty by adding 2–4 lbs to belt
* Do not increase time — only weight
---
### 🔫 BONUS TOOL: **Spearfishing for Tactical Confidence**
* Candidates should spearfish weekly if possible
* Must follow **Level 1–2 freediving protocols**
* Use sessions to build real-world tolerance, comfort, sink-phase entry, and breath control
---
## ⚠️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS
* All underwater drills must be supervised
* Never combine max attempts with CO₂ tables
* Warm-ups must trigger MDR without fatigue (NPDs, facial immersion, etc.)
* No Wim Hof, hyperventilation, or box breathing allowed
---
## 🎯 SYSTEM GOAL:
Prepare military candidates to:
* Handle combat water stress
* Maintain calm and function during gear loss/failure
* Build to 5:00+ static capacity
* Operate confidently during drownproofing, retrieval, and amphibious ops
Let the water become your environment — not your enemy.
