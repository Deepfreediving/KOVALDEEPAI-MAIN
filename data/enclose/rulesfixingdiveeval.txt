1. ❌ Error: Recommending 2–3 dives to 85–95m
Fix:
✅ Only 1 dive per session to 75–85% of max depth is allowed.
✅ This must be a test or target dive with full recovery after.
✅ Never recommend multiple deep dives in a session unless specifically requested.

2. ❌ Error: Incorrect surface interval recommendation (4:30–5:00 min)
Fix:
✅ Follow strict interval rules:
>40m but <60m → 12 min surface interval (optional +5 min O₂)
≥60m → 16 min surface interval (optional +5 min O₂)
✅ O₂ protocol = 2.5 min on / 1 min off / 2.5 min on — never exceed 5 min total.
✅ Never use O₂ while hyperventilating or before recovery breathing is completed.

3. ❌ Error: Recommending long hangs (20–30m) after deep dives
Fix:
✅ Never recommend repetitive dives or hangs after a deep dive (>RV).
✅ Risk of lung squeeze is increased due to plasma fill — must allow full lung re-expansion.
✅ Emphasize single deep dive → full recovery → no additional compression dives.

4. ❌ Error: Implying that LMC and blackout are fully preventable
Fix:
✅ Revise to: “LMC and blackout may not be preventable, but with proper direct supervision and safety protocols, they can be managed safely without long-term consequences.”
✅ Always enforce “1 up, 1 down”, 30-second observation, and triple OK check.

5. ❌ Error: Misuse of rescue terminology — Blow-Tap-Talk labeled as a position
Fix:
✅ Clarify:
Doe-se-doe = position (arm across neck, airway protected, face supported)
Blow-Tap-Talk = stimulation method after airway is secure
✅ Use only after transitioning into Doe-se-doe.

6. ❌ Error: Advising against full-exhale NPDs to 40–50m by default
Fix:
✅ Rule: Full exhale NPDs to 40–50m are valid for advanced Level 2+ divers working on mouthfill pressure adaptation.
✅ However, offer safer alternatives (20–30m NPDs with reverse packing) if fatigue, risk, or time is a concern.
✅ Let diver choose based on energy balance and adaptation phase.

7. ❌ Error: Lacking mouthfill technique or diagnostic logic
Fix:
✅ Always ask:
"Are you having any issues with mouthfill, equalization, soft palate, or glottis control?"
✅ If yes → trigger checklist guide for evaluation
✅ Include volume assessment, technique (glottis lock, tongue control), pressure sensitivity, and red-flag symptoms like air swallowing or disappearing mouthfill.

8. ❌ Error: Unverified soft palate/swallowing protocols
Fix:
✅ Soft palate locking must be linked to involuntary override near RV or air swallowing due to contraction onset.
✅ Tools like Glottis & Soft Palate Simulation and Reverse Packing must be recommended for re-training control.

9. ❌ Error: Suggesting mouthfill is disappearing or failing without evaluation
Fix:
✅ Always ask:
“At what depth are you taking your mouthfill?”
“How full is your mouthfill?”
“Where are you running out of air?”
“Are you swallowing it or losing pressure?”
✅ Use these answers to determine if the issue is:
Volume too small or too shallow
Poor glottis lock
Contractions overriding mouthfill hold

10. ❌ Error: General misuse or compression of tools in training plan
Fix:
✅ Every tool must be offered as:
A named clickable reference (e.g., “Type ‘Reverse Packing Drill’ to open full instructions.”)
OR presented in full detail with medical-grade structure if not clickable.
✅ Must never truncate or compress tool instructions if the tool is referenced in a plan.
