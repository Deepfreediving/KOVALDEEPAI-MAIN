📘 E.N.C.L.O.S.E. Diagnostic Routing Guide
==========================================

This file defines all assistant routing behavior and training logic responses based on user input from the EN.C.L.O.S.E. tool.

Trigger Phrase:
---------------
“EN.C.L.O.S.E.” or “I don’t know my issue”

Logic:
------
- Offer user full EN.C.L.O.S.E. diagnostic tool
- After identifying category (E, N, C, L, O, S, E), route user to the corresponding diagnostic guide

==========================================================
E – Equalization Issues
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "I can't equalize"
- "My EQ fails"
- "My ears hurt"
- "Air is stuck"
- "Mouthfill failed"
- "Can't reverse pack"

🛠️ Route to:
- Soft Palate/Glottis EQ Guide (if they say “I have air but can’t equalize”)
- Reverse Packing Drills (Level 2+)
- Mouthfill Diagnostic Tool (Level 3+)
- Valsalva → Frenzel Training (if using Valsalva)
- Dry EQ Tools (Level 1 only)

==========================================================
N – Nitrogen Narcosis (Depth >35m)
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "I felt loopy"
- "Vision tunnelled"
- "Everything slowed down"
- "I forgot what I was doing at depth"

🛠️ Route to:
- Narcosis Safety Protocol
- Depth progression halt (if symptoms recur)
- CO₂/O₂ recalibration drills
- Review of surface interval strategy

==========================================================
C – CO₂ Tolerance / Early Contractions
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "I got contractions early"
- "Urge to breathe came fast"
- "Couldn't relax"
- "Panicked on the way up"

🛠️ Route to:
- CO₂ Tables (2x/week max)
- Visualization + Static Hangs
- Streamlining, reduced exertion tools
- Adjust warm-up to reduce CO₂ buildup

==========================================================
L – Leg Fatigue / Finning Issues
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "Legs were burning"
- "My kick felt weak"
- "I lost power"
- "Bad form"

🛠️ Route to:
- Finning technique drills (video or dry)
- Anterior tibialis + glute strengthening
- Adjust kick stroke cycle
- Add sink phase earlier

==========================================================
O – Oxygen Management / Recovery
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "I was dizzy"
- "LMC"
- "Blackout"
- "Long recovery"
- "Out of breath after surfacing"

🛠️ Route to:
- O₂ Protocol: 2.5 min ON / 1 min OFF / 2.5 min ON
- Emphasize recovery breathing protocols
- Warm-up revision
- Reduce exertion or max effort dives
- Emphasize supervision, safety logic

==========================================================
S – Squeeze Risk (Sinus, Lung, Throat)
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "There was blood"
- "Throat tightness"
- "Sinus pain"
- "Coughing after dive"

🛠️ Route to:
- Squeeze symptoms explanation
- Thoracic squeeze prevention drills (NPD, dry EQ)
- Delay diving when congested
- Add flexibility and relaxation drills

==========================================================
E – Equipment Setup Issues
----------------------------------------------------------
🔍 User Statements:
- "Mask leak"
- "Nose clip came off"
- "Wetsuit too tight"
- "Fins don’t feel right"
- "Something felt off"

🛠️ Route to:
- Equipment fitting checklist
- Adjust weights
- Gear-specific troubleshooting
- Nose clip vs. mask guidance
- Streamlining correction

==========================================================
🔁 Reminders for Assistant Logic
----------------------------------------------------------
- Always confirm freediving certification level before recommending drills.
- All dry drills and tools must follow user level restrictions.
- Ask for clarification if user gives vague input (“EQ failed” → follow-up: “Did you have air or did it run out?”).
- Confirm if user wants a training plan, educational explanation, or tool prescription.

“The most important thing isn’t knowing everything — it’s learning how to ask the right question. EN.C.L.O.S.E. helps you get there.”
