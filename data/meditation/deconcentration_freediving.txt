🧠 Deconcentration Techniques for Freedivers
🔍 What is Deconcentration?
Deconcentration is the practice of broadening awareness to the entire field of sensory input without focusing on any one point. Unlike concentration (narrow focus), deconcentration allows the nervous system to downregulate, reducing tension, improving equalization control, and deepening relaxation.
✅ Who Should Use It?
Only recommended for freedivers consistently diving 60m+
Why?
At elite depths, the diver must allow technique to run subconsciously
Deconcentration supports non-reactivity, deep equalization, and flow state
❌ Who Should Not Use It Yet?
Freedivers diving shallower than 60m should avoid this technique — unless managing overwhelming fear.
Why?
It can:
Overload the mind with too much input
Distract from primary technique development
Reduce performance by fragmenting focus
Interfere with learning proper structure and body awareness
🧠 Expert Quote (Daniel Koval):“Deconcentration is like switching to autopilot — but you need to program that autopilot first. Until your foundation is solid, it’s better to focus on just one thing per dive.”
⚠️ Exception: Beginners with High Anxiety
If a beginner has intense fear or panic underwater, limited deconcentration (especially auditory or visual) can reduce over-focus on fear and restore calm.
✅ When Should It Be Used?
Deconcentration is the practice of broadening awareness to the entire field of sensory input without focusing on any one point. Unlike concentration (narrow focus), deconcentration allows the nervous system to downregulate, reducing tension, improving equalization control, and deepening relaxation.
🎯 Why It Matters in Freediving
Calms overactive mind and pre-dive anxiety
Suppresses sympathetic (fight-or-flight) responses
Improves diaphragm and glottis control
Increases baroreceptor and stretch receptor tolerance
Supports flow state and subconscious equalization
🧘‍♂️ Core Deconcentration Techniques
1. Visual Field Deconcentration
When to use: Before static, during descent, or during hang phase
How to do it:
Soften your gaze
Become aware of everything in your peripheral vision
Try to see “everything and nothing” — a 180° visual field
Let go of focus on one object (e.g., the line or your hand)
What it does:
Reduces cortical activity
Shuts down internal dialogue
Enhances parasympathetic response
2. Auditory Deconcentration
When to use: During hang, static, or dynamic
How to do it:
Expand your awareness to all background sounds (not just one)
Accept all noises — water movement, heartbeats, underwater clicks and flow
Don’t analyze, just “hear everything at once”
What it does:
Shifts brain activity into alpha/theta states
Allows flow without fixation
Enhances calm awareness
3. Body-Wide Sensory Deconcentration
When to use: In training during sink phase, freefall, or negative pressure dives. Frc’s etc.
How to do it:
Mentally “scan” your entire body, then let it go
Hold an equal awareness of all contact points — water flowing over your face with noseclip, embrace the thermoclines, tongue position, throat tension, diaphragm relaxation- Be everywhere inside and nowhere at once!
After you have a structured automatic dive to a high level of technique, Instead of focusing on one issue (e.g., chest squeeze), expand to whole-body neutrality-
What it does:
Helps prevent fixation on discomfort
Facilitates non-reactivity to pressure or contractions
Supports deep equalization by avoiding overcorrection
4. Internal Space Deconcentration (Advanced)
When to use: Advanced depth diving, RV dives, FRC training
How to do it:
Shift attention to the space inside — the feel of air in your mouth, throat, chest, and sinuses
Let attention sit in the “emptiness” of your body
Be aware of internal stillness rather than external stimuli
What it does:
Reinforces passive state and efficiency
Reduces equalization errors caused by micro-tension
Anchors the mind in present-moment experience
📌 Key Coaching Tips
Deconcentration should not feel effortful — if you're trying hard, you're concentrating
It’s best trained outside of max efforts
Combine with slow nasal breathing during dry practice
Use it to transition from thinking mode → sensing mode
🧠 Daniel Koval’s Expert Insight (Recommended Integration)
“Freediving isn’t about shutting the mind down — it’s about widening it so much that thought has nowhere to stick. When your awareness is everywhere, there’s nothing left to panic or fixate on.”
🧠 How to Train Deconcentration for Freediving
🔹 Stage 1: Dry Training (Baseline Awareness)
Goal: Train your brain to shift from focused to panoramic awareness without stress.
🔸 Exercise: Soft Gaze Drill
Sit in a quiet space.
Pick a point on the wall, but then soften your gaze.
Begin to notice the edges of your visual field.
Try to “see everything and nothing” — don’t move your eyes.
Hold for 2-3 minutes building up to 3–5 minutes, breathing slowly.
✔️ Use before breath-holds, work, or as a daily reset.
🔹 Stage 2: Dry Apnea Training (Deconcentration Under Stress)
Goal: Maintain deconcentration as contractions or O₂ depletion increase.
🔸 Exercise: Eyes-Open CO₂ Table with Deconcentration
Perform a CO₂ table with eyes open and in soft gaze mode.
Maintain wide visual or auditory awareness during each hold.
As contractions begin, stay with whole-body sensation, not just the urge to breathe.
After each breath-hold, reflect: Did my awareness collapse inward? What pulled me out?
✔️ This builds resilience to focus collapse under discomfort.
🔹 Stage 3: In-Water Static Training
Goal: Deconcentrate under real-world breath-hold conditions.
🔸 Exercise: Floating Awareness Static
Begin a standard breath-hold in pool or ocean with buddy supervision.
Once settled, enter visual field deconcentration:
See water, pool edge, spectacles in the water etc. as a whole.
Switch to auditory field deconcentration:
Become aware of every sound, planes flying overhead, people chatting, movement of water — not just your heartbeat.
At the first contractions, try body deconcentration:
Be aware of every point of contact with the water, wetsuit, buoyancy, facial immersion.
✔️ Make it a ritual before depth sessions.
🔹 Stage 4: Depth Training Integration
Goal: Use deconcentration to enter flow state during descent and freefall.
🔸 Drill: Equalization with Deconcentration
Begin your descent with full visual field awareness.
As you pass neutral buoyancy, shift attention outward, not inward.
Beyond initial structure of dive, kick cycles, mouthfill, reverse packing, etc. Practice equalizing from a state of whole body awareness proceeding through an entire body check — avoid micro-fixation on ears, speed, or mouthfill.
Let go of perfecting — instead, perceive your whole descent as one fluid process.
✔️ If you lose awareness or have a misfire, reset on the next dive — no judgment.
🧘‍♂️ Bonus: Meditative Flow Training (Dry or In-Water)
Practice holding whole-body awareness for 10+ minutes:
No object focus
No thought analysis
Just being in all sensations simultaneously
This builds the neurological base for in-dive flow.
🧠 Training Tips
Use a journal to track which senses you can deconcentrate most easily (vision, hearing, body).
Never judge when you “snap back” into focus — just start over gently.
Practice before sleep, before statics, or during slow walks or swims.
Combine with diaphragm work and dry mouthfill drills for flow-state synergy.
🧠 Deconcentration vs. Meditation – What’s the Difference?
🔍 Key Freediving Insight:
Meditation helps prepare the nervous system.
Deconcentration helps you perform while freediving.
🎯 Why Deconcentration Is Superior for In-Dive Flow
While meditation trains your focus, deconcentration trains your field of awareness.
Freedivers need to remain aware of subtle physical signals (diaphragm tension, mouthfill pressure, stretch reflex) without getting locked on them.
Concentration can lead to overcorrection or panic when something feels wrong.
Deconcentration lets you observe tension without reacting, allowing subconscious reflexes (like Frenzel or equalization) to work freely.
🧠 Analogy:
Meditation is like sitting in the middle of a still lake, eyes closed.
Deconcentration is like swimming through that lake with your eyes wide open, sensing everything but holding on to nothing.
🧘‍♂️ Use Both — But Know When:
🟢 Meditation: Dry land, pre-session, post-dive recovery
🟢 Deconcentration: During freefall, hangs, FRC/NPD, and when CO₂/urge to breathe rises
--- TABLE ---
Training Context | Bot Action
Static apnea | ✅ Always recommend deconcentration to reduce mental tension and improve comfort
Dynamic apnea | ✅ Always recommend visual or body deconcentration for smoother pacing and relaxation
Dry warm-up exercises (NPDs, dry equalization drills) | ✅ Always recommend light deconcentration to promote whole-body awareness and calm nervous system
Depth diving ≥ 60m | ✅ Actively recommend full-body/internal deconcentration for freefall, mouthfill, and flow state integration
Depth diving < 60m (no fear) | ❌ Do not recommend. Too advanced. Focus on one technique per dive for better learning and awareness
Depth diving < 60m (high fear/anxiety) | ✅ May recommend gentle auditory or visual deconcentration to reduce panic response and prevent over-fixation
