Freediving Diagnostic Checklist

Mouthfill Diagnostic:
I take my mouthfill shallower than 22m.
I take my mouthfill while still finning, not during the sink phase.
I take a very full mouthfill, but it disappears by X. Include depth with number
I feel like I’m using a lot of effort to hold the mouthfill.
Despite full mouthfill I run out of air slowly with each equalization between 60–80m.
I swallow the mouthfill or lose it during the dive.
I take my mouthfill too early because of fear or tension.
If you selected 1–2: Mouthfill timing issue
If you selected 3–6: Mouthfill volume or technique issue
If you selected 7: Psychological/tension-based compensation
Recommended Tools: Reverse Packing Drill, Simulated Mouthfill, Mouthfill Timing Dive

Equalization Diagnostic:
I can equalize perfectly on FRC dives, but struggle on full inhale dives.
I equalize well to 30m, but EQ becomes more difficult after that.
I can’t EQ well and I feel tightness in the chest or throat.
I feel like I’m pushing equalizations instead of them happening effortlessly.
I can’t EQ once I feel contractions.
If you selected 8, 10, or 11: You may have tension-based EQ restriction
If you selected 9: You may be hitting early RV-related limits
If you selected 12: EQ and glottis coordination under stress is the issue
Recommended Tools: Tool 2 Reverse Packing, Tool 3 Deep EQ Timing, Tool 4 Mouthfill Contractions

Glottis Control Diagnostic:
I don’t know how to identify my glottis.
I can’t tell when my glottis is open vs closed.
I feel like air escapes from my mouth when I try to equalize.
I lose control of the mouthfill when contractions start.
I can’t seal the glottis after taking a mouthfill.
If you selected 13–14: Need to train glottis identification
If you selected 15, 16, or 17: Weak glottis coordination under pressure
Recommended Tools: Glottis Isolation Drill (Tool 1), Reverse Pack + Lock (Tool 2), Mouthfill EQ with Contractions (Tool 4)

Soft Palate Control Diagnostic:
I feel like my teeth are clinched together and holding the air forward in cheeks around 50–60m.
My soft palate locks during descent, preventing EQ.
I feel like I can’t push air into the tubes, even though I have a full mouthfill.
I get a strange "gulping" reflex or sudden swallow before RV.
If you selected 18–19: Soft palate is locking due to pressure/tension
If you selected 20–21: Poor soft palate positioning or redirection
Recommended Tools: Soft Palate Awareness, Glottis/Palate Coordination, Tongue Extension Test (Tool 1)
