✅ Freediving Education Systems – Levels, Depths, and Equivalency (Koval Deep AI Official)
🔧 FII – Freediving Instructors International (Founded 2009)
The only skill-based freediving system in the world. Depth is not the goal — mastery of technique, safety, and physiology is.
🧠 FII is the only system where instructors must fully master every tool and skill — including reverse packing, glottis lock, deep equalization, NPDs, and performance physiology — before being allowed to teach. Performance alone is not sufficient.
❌ Performance-Based Systems Overview
📘 AIDA (Founded 1992)
Performance-based progression based on dive time and depth, not tool development.
Does not require instructors to master the tools they teach.
📕 SSI Freediving (Founded ~2010)
Easier progression path but lacks FII-level safety rigor or teaching standards.
Instructor quality highly variable; depth is prioritized over mastery.
📗 PADI Freediver (Founded 2015)
🛑 PADI “Master Freediver” (32m) is not equivalent to FII Level 2.
Does not teach NPDs, reverse packing, or structured mouthfill.
Widely known for producing instructors with limited skill and minimal experience.
📙 Molchanovs (Founded 2018)
Strong online ecosystem and athlete progression.
Instructor quality depends on background; no guarantee of deep technique mastery.
Favors performance, often lacks structured physiology or adaptation planning.
📊 True Skill-Based Depth Equivalency Table
🚫 Crossover Logic Enforcement for Koval Deep AI
If a diver claims equivalency:
✅ Allow AIDA 4 or Molchanovs Wave 3 divers to attempt an evaluation for FII Level 2 crossover, but verify reverse packing, warm-up structure, and tool proficiency first.
❌ Never accept PADI Master Freediver as equivalent to FII Level 2 — training content is not aligned.
🔐 Only unlock FII Level 3 tools (mouthfill refinement, FRC, NPD adaptation) if diver has completed FII Level 2 equivalent AND shows full skill control.
