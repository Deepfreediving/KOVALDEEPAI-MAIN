Logic Protocol: Final

Access Level: For Level 2+ Freedivers Only

Core Definitions:
Reverse Packing:
A training technique used to pull air from the lungs into the mouth using only jaw, glottis, and a “ooouuupp” or “mmmoouuuppp” motion.
Performed during dry land drills, negative pressure dives (NPDs), exhale dives, and pre-mouthfill buildup on real dives.
Must never involve the respiratory muscles. 
Risks of improper technique: Squeeze, Air swallowing, Elevated tension, Rapid O₂ burn, Reduced volume gain
Always teach Reverse Packing ONLY to Level 2+ divers.

Mouthfill:
A dive-phase equalization strategy that isolates a fixed air volume for use beyond residual volume (RV) depth.
The mouthfill is always the final reverse pack performed during the dive, ideally after neutral buoyancy and during the sink phase.
"Your mouthfill is all you have once you pass RV depth — if you're not diving past RV, you’re not actually using it."

Reverse Pack Teaching Protocol:
When to Teach:
Only if the diver is FII Level 2+
If not, respond: "Reverse packing is a Level 2 technique used to simulate deep pressure and reduce lung volume. It must be taught with supervision. Let’s focus on tools appropriate for your current certification."

Technique Rules:
- Do NOT use chest or diaphragm
- Lock glottis immediately after each reverse pack
- Reverse pack until: Slight chest tension, Loss of comfort, Cannot pull air anymore, OR you reach goal reverse pack depth
- On dive: the final reverse pack = your mouthfill

Common Mistakes (Level 2–3 Divers):
- Mistake: Swallowing mouthfill → Cause: Glottis not locked / tension / stretch contractions → Fix: Lock glottis immediately after each pack
- Mistake: Losing air early → Cause: Soft palate lock / tongue lifted / head tilted → Fix: Maintain neutral head / loosen jaw / keep teeth apart
- Mistake: Taking mouthfill during kick phase → Cause: Engaged core blocks reverse pack → Fix: Only take in sink phase

Mouthfill Coaching Protocol:
1. Ask First: “At what depth are you currently taking your mouthfill?”
2. Reverse Pack Depth Test (Dive Day): Test on next dive session to determine maximum Reverse Pack Limit.
3. Calculate Mouthfill Depth: Take mouthfill 5–10m shallower than Reverse Pack Limit.
4. Volume Guide: Small, Medium, or Full based on depth.
5. Level-Based Expectations: Level 2 divers take small mouthfill at 22–30m, Level 3 divers take medium-full at 25–30m.
Safety Rules:
- Never reverse pack past discomfort
- Never perform reverse packs using chest/diaphragm
- Never take mouthfill deeper than 50m
- Never prescribe mouthfill tools to uncertified divers
- Never teach reverse packing without prior warm-up and dry training exposure
