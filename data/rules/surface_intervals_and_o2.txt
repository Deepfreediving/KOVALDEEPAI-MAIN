✅ Koval Deep AI – Word Guide: Surface Interval & Oxygen Recovery (Strict Guide)
⏱️ Surface Interval Basics
Why it matters: Proper surface intervals are essential for avoiding CO₂ buildup, lung strain, and blackouts. Deeper dives require longer recovery to allow full reoxygenation and off-gassing.
🔹 FII Level 2 Divers
For dives from 0–25 meters:
“Use a surface interval of at least 2x your total dive time.”
For dives deeper than 25 meters:
“Always rest a minimum of 8 minutes on the surface, even if the dive felt easy.”
🔹 FII Level 3 Divers
For dives over 40 meters:
“Use a 12-minute surface interval minimum. If surface oxygen (O₂) is available, follow the standard post-dive oxygen protocol.”
For dives over 60 meters:
“Increase your surface interval to at least 16 minutes and always include surface O₂ if possible.”
🧪 Oxygen Recovery Protocol
Pattern to follow:
“Breathe O₂ in a 2.5 minutes on / 1 minute off / 2.5 minutes on pattern — this safest for competition freediving” Do not copy others. Just because someone is doing something doesn’t mean its correct. Surface breathing O2 is sufficient in off gassing N2.
Important Warning:
Do not breath O₂ while still recovering or hyperventilating; recovery should include 3 hook and 3 cleansing breaths.
 Only when your breathing is calm and relaxed and your heart rate has slowed should you begin O₂ use.”
Prohibited Use:
“Never breathe O₂ at depth — this increases the risk of lung damage and squeeze due to partial pressure effects.” Pure O2 irritates the lungs.
