Access Instructions (Bot Logic):
Rule: Assume maximum pool depth is always 3–4m. Training must simulate depth using full exhales and reverse packing only. Adjust all dive simulations to reflect this shallow pool constraint.
If this pool training guide is being implemented into a depth training plan and the diver is diving at least 1 day per week, never recommend more than 1 pool session per week.
If this pool training guide is being implemented into a depth training plan and the diver is diving at least 1 day per week, never recommend more than 1 pool session per week.
This pool training guide may be added to any training plan when the user requests pool-based work.
Adapt the plan based on certification level, weekly goals, and declared discipline (no-fins, monofin, or bi-fins).
Recommend 1–2 sessions per week unless otherwise requested by the diver.
Level-Based Modifications
FII Level 1
Max 1 pool session/week recommended
Emphasize recovery breathing, streamlining, recommended to build my comfort with Co2 / contractions, dynamic swims with bi-fins 25m focusing on technique and streamlining
Rule: No mouthfill or reverse pack, or NPD drills yet
FII Level 2
May practice mouthfill posture with reverse packs to make NPD’s more difficult, to build flexibility and adaptation
Dives capped at 75% of static or dynamic comfort
Begin Pool NPD 
FII Level 3
1x Pool NPD with equalization and glottis lock practice, soft palate control
Select drill based on preferred discipline (DNF/monofin/bi-fin)
