# Boyle, Dalton, Archimedes — Practical Freediving

Understanding the physics that govern freediving helps you make safer, more efficient decisions about technique, timing, and safety.

## Boyle's Law — Pressure & Volume

### The Basic Principle

**P₁V₁ = P₂V₂** — As pressure increases, gas volume decreases proportionally.

### Practical Application

**Pressure at depth**: P(depth) = 1 + depth/10 atmospheres

- Surface (0m): 1 ATA
- 10m: 2 ATA
- 30m: 4 ATA
- 100m: 11 ATA

### What This Means for Divers

**Air Spaces Compress:**

- Lungs at 100m = 1/11th surface volume
- Mouthfill at 100m = 1/11th the volume you took
- Mask space compresses (risk of squeeze)

**Equalization Volume Requirements:**

- Deeper = more compressed air needed per equalization
- Why mouthfill timing matters: take it before maximum compression
- Why small, frequent doses work better than big, rare pushes

**Residual Volume (RV) Depth:**
When lung volume compresses to your RV, you can't access more air:

- **RV Depth** = (TLC ÷ RV - 1) × 10 meters
- Typical recreational: ~40-50m
- **Elite freedivers**: 70-80m (RV ~0.3-0.5L vs typical 1.0-1.5L)

## Dalton's Law — Partial Pressures

### The Principle

Total pressure = sum of partial pressures of all gases.

### Practical Application

**Oxygen Partial Pressure:**

- At surface: O₂ partial pressure = 0.21 ATA
- At 30m (4 ATA): O₂ partial pressure = 0.84 ATA
- Higher O₂ partial pressure = better tissue oxygenation at depth

**Carbon Dioxide Effects:**

- CO₂ partial pressure also increases with depth
- Affects urge to breathe and narcosis onset
- Why relaxation and efficiency matter more at depth

**Nitrogen Narcosis:**

- N₂ partial pressure increases linearly with depth
- Narcosis typically noticeable beyond 30-40m
- Affects judgment, coordination, and technique

## Archimedes' Principle — Buoyancy

### The Principle

Buoyancy force = weight of displaced water.

### Practical Application

**Buoyancy Changes with Depth:**

- **Positive buoyancy** (0-10m): Must kick down, burns energy
- **Neutral zone** (~10-15m): Effortless gliding
- **Negative buoyancy** (15m+): Natural sinking, conserve energy

**Body Position Effects:**

- **Head-down**: Mouthfill "sits below" lungs, better retention
- **Streamlined**: Less drag = less energy = longer breath-hold
- **Relaxed**: Reduced oxygen consumption

**Wetsuit Compression:**

- Neoprene compresses with depth
- Buoyancy becomes more negative
- Weight distribution may need adjustment

## Combined Effects — Why Technique Matters

### Early Descent (0-30m)

- **High lung volume** + positive buoyancy = higher energy cost
- **Dense equalization** needed (pressure changes rapidly)
- **Technique focus**: Efficient movement, consistent EQ cadence

### Mid-Descent (30-70m)

- **Approaching RV** = mouthfill timing becomes critical
- **Narcosis onset** = maintain focus on technique
- **Negative buoyancy** = conserve energy, perfect streamline

### Deep Phase (70m+)

- **Past RV** = mouthfill is your only equalization source
- **Maximum compression** = small volumes, precise dosing
- **High partial pressures** = efficiency and safety paramount

## Practical Decision Making

### Mouthfill Timing

**Physics tells you when:**

- Too early = unnecessary compression and loss
- Too late = insufficient volume for deep equalization
- **Optimal**: Near your functional RV depth

### Equalization Cadence

**Physics tells you frequency:**

- Shallow: Frequent (pressure changes rapidly)
- Deep: Precise dosing (limited air supply)
- Never force: Physics limits what's possible

### Safety Margins

**Physics sets the boundaries:**

- RV depth = absolute air supply limit
- Partial pressure effects = cognitive function changes
- Compression ratios = squeeze risk assessment

## Key Takeaways

1. **Pressure increases linearly** (1 ATA per 10m)
2. **Volume decreases proportionally** (Boyle's law)
3. **Gas effects intensify** with partial pressure (Dalton's law)
4. **Buoyancy shifts** change energy requirements (Archimedes)
5. **Physics sets limits** — technique works within them, never against them

Understanding these principles helps you:

- Time mouthfill for maximum efficiency
- Plan equalization cadence appropriately
- Recognize when physics, not technique, sets the limit
- Make safer decisions about progression and abort points

**Bottom line**: Physics is your guide, not your enemy. Work with the laws of nature for safer, more efficient diving.
