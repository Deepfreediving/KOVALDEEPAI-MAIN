# E.N.C.L.O.S.E. — Diagnostic Routing Guide

**For Koval Deep AI logic and coaching use**

Use this structure to systematically evaluate dive performance. Ask targeted follow-up questions to identify root causes of performance issues or discomfort. Only offer coaching after clear diagnostic understanding.

## **E** — Equalization Issues

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- Did EQ fail at a specific depth?
- Was there tension or discomfort?
- Did you swallow your mouthfill or run out of air?
- Did you reverse pack too early?
- Do you have air but can't equalize?
- Nose clip or mask issue?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Bad technique (Valsalva reliance, poor Frenzel mechanics)
- Soft palate or glottis tension
- Incorrect mouthfill management
- Sinus congestion or illness
- Cold water or poor head position
- **BTV-specific**: Tongue-soft palate lock, weak TVP

### ✅ Recommendations:

- 100+ daily dry EQ reps only for Level 1 (shirtless, in mirror)
- Review mouthfill mechanics
- Use dry EQ training tools (NPD, reverse packing, mouthfill drills for Level 2+)
- Delay diving if congested or showing sinus squeeze symptoms
- **BTV users**: Tongue-out test, TVP strengthening, switch to micro-Frenzel hybrid

---

## **N** — Nitrogen Narcosis (Deep Dives >35m)

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- Any confusion, tunnel vision, euphoria, or disorientation at depth?
- Did it occur consistently at the same depth?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Dive depth beyond current adaptation
- Fatigue, low O₂, or elevated CO₂ levels

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Progress slowly in 2–3m increments
- Dive rested and relaxed
- Increase surface intervals
- Stop progression until symptoms disappear

---

## **C** — CO₂ Tolerance (Urge to Breathe, Early Contractions)

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- When did contractions start?
- How intense were they?
- Did they disrupt focus or technique?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Poor CO₂ tolerance
- Overbreathing
- Mental tension or anxiety
- Inefficient streamlining or finning

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Dry CO₂ tables (1–2x/week max)
- Visualization drills pre-dive
- Urge-to-breathe static hangs
- Improve streamlining and relaxation

---

## **L** — Leg Burn / Muscle Fatigue

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- Were legs burning early?
- Was finning tense or sloppy?
- Pigeon-toe or bicycle kicking present?
- Was sink phase triggered on time?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Poor finning technique
- Weak legs or low anaerobic capacity
- Inappropriate warm-up
- Improper fins

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Dynamic apnea sprints
- Anterior tibialis strengthening
- Use smaller training fins if form breaks
- Adjust sink phase timing (kick cycle or alarm)

---

## **O** — O₂ Tolerance / Recovery

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- LMC or blackout?
- Visual disturbances, cyanosis, tingling, dizziness, or euphoria?
- Was recovery slow or incomplete?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Overtraining or dive overreach
- Poor O₂ tolerance
- Strained equalization or inefficient descent
- Tension or mental stress

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Step back 5–10m to rebuild confidence
- Dry O₂ tables (1–2x/week max, never with CO₂ tables)
- Increase surface intervals and rest days
- Focus on complete hook and recovery breathing

---

## **S** — Squeeze (Trachea / Bronchial / Lung)

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- Any throat scratch, cough, pain, or blood?
- Was the dive at or beyond RV?
- Cold conditions? Rapid descent?
- Poor MF or head position?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Tense descent, improper reverse pack timing
- Forced EQ under pressure
- Soft palate lift or mouthfill loss
- Mask squeeze, core tension, lack of flexibility

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Rest 1–2 weeks if blood is present
- Restart at half depth and progress slowly
- Fix head and MF technique (don't lift chin)
- Build flexibility with NPDs and MDR warm-ups

---

## **E** — Equipment & Gear Issues

### 🔍 Evaluate:

- Mask leaks, fogging, pressure?
- Wetsuit too tight or compressing chest?
- Fins too soft or stiff?
- Weight belt sliding or pulling?

### 🛠️ Possible Causes:

- Ill-fitting wetsuit or mask
- Improper neck weight distribution
- Mismatched fin stiffness to dive style

### ✅ Recommendations:

- Refit wetsuit and adjust thickness for water temp
- Use silicone belt to reduce slippage
- Replace or modify fins as needed
- Rebalance weight for 10m neutral buoyancy

## 🧠 Why It Works

E.N.C.L.O.S.E. helps "enclose" the root causes of performance issues. Each letter is a diagnostic category to wrap structure around analysis.

## 🗣️ Coaching Phrases:

- "Let's enclose the weaknesses from this dive and address them."
- "Before moving forward, we need to enclose all the factors affecting your performance."
- "Each dive should be enclosed by clarity, not confusion."

## AI Routing Logic

### Question Classification

Route user questions to appropriate E.N.C.L.O.S.E. category:

- **Depth plateaus** → E (Equalization) + S (Squeeze)
- **Early contractions** → C (CO₂ Tolerance)
- **Leg fatigue** → L (Leg Burn)
- **Mental issues** → N (Narcosis) or O (O₂)
- **Gear problems** → E (Equipment)

### Follow-up Questions

Once category identified, drill down with specific diagnostic questions from that section.

### Coaching Sequence

1. **Diagnose** using E.N.C.L.O.S.E. framework
2. **Identify** root cause(s)
3. **Prescribe** specific drills/solutions
4. **Link** to relevant knowledge base articles
5. **Plan** progressive training approach

This systematic approach ensures consistent, thorough analysis of dive performance issues.
