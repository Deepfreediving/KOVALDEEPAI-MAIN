1. üõ†Ô∏è NPD FOR THE POOL or shallow water where depth is limited- (Pool training tool- pool use only) Always recommend for level 2,3+ freedivers to practice at the end of every pool training

Level 2 and 3 freedivers only

‚úÖ¬†Step-by-Step Instructions

Surface Prep

- Use nose clip or manually pinch nose with mask

- Always done with proper freediving equipment

- Relax sitting or holding on to the edge of the pool

- When comfortable take a Full exhale and start with 2 reverse packs exhaling reverse pack volume out of the mouth. 

- Then holding the 2nd or 3rd as your mouthfill (so you have air to equalize and to the bottom of the pool.)

- Add more RP to increase challenge

- Pre-equalize at surface

- Enter water head-down with head in a tucked position

- Descend to the bottom of the pool like in sink phase maybe with small kicks

- Relaxed descent to pool bottom (~3‚Äì4m)

- Equalize continuously

- Keep head TUCKED and diaphragm, core, and chest relaxed

- Stay head down while comfortable but no more than¬†10 seconds equalizing repeatedly

Ascent

- Perform a gentle forward somersault

- Ascend slowly alongside safety diver

Progressive Reverse packs (RP)

- Add +2 more reverse packs per repetition

- Increase slowly over 6-8 total reps

- Rest 1-2 minutes between each rep

Stop Immediately If:

- Tickling or coughing

- Chest tightness or pain

- Equalization fails

- Throat discomfort or scratchiness

üß† Coaching Tip:

Useful to test Frenzel vs. Valsalva: Most important practice for level 2+ freedivers trying to master their frenzel maneuver and remove all bad Valsalva habits- this guarantees the freediver is doing frenzel maneuver if they do this properly

2. üõ†Ô∏è The ULTIMATE FRENZEL FATTAH EQUALIZATION TEST- Always give tool too people struggling to switch from Valsalva to full frenzel and after the level 2 freediving course- Everyone needs to master this tool

- Use mask only for this drill

- Perform a full exhale + hold mouthfill from the surface

- Pre-equalize and descend with head in a neutral position to bottom of the pool.

- Inverted head down at bottom of pool, try to reverse pack, lock glottis, and compress the air from the mouth into the sinus as if to equalize. Do this as many times as you can until it is impossible to reverse pack.

- If you are unable to get air to come out the nose keep trying ‚Äì Daniel‚Äòs Expert TIP-‚Äú when you are ready to exhale out the nose squint your face slightly to perform a gap between tongue and soft palate and compress the jaw, squeeze cheeks, and roll tongue backwards. All will help create pressure to force air out the sinuses.‚Äù

- If bubbles are coming out the nose or the bottom of the skirt of the mask = Congratulations! you are successfully doing the full Frenzel Fattah maneuver with combined mouthfill and proper compression.

- Bubbles = successful Frenzel (if nose was pinched, it would equalize)
