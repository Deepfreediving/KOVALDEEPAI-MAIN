🟡 FII Level 2/3 Freediver — Training Negative Pressure Dive Variations to Improve Specific Issues

Depth Only Protocol

1. 🛠️ Reverse Packing Progression NPD — Primary NPD Tool

Best for:
• Intermediate/advanced divers with moderate depth access around 20m / 66ft.
• Reverse packing / mouthfill training tool.
• Practicing pressure adaptation, mouthfill control, and training the Mammalian Dive Reflex (MDR).
• Simulating dives beyond Residual Volume (RV), improving flexibility, and refining reverse packing technique.

🔧 How to Perform It – Structured Protocol:
1. Do with noseclip ideally or mask
2. Full exhale on the surface, pre-equalize
2. Descend using Free Immersion (FIM) with your head always in a tucked position
3. Repeat on the way down:
   - Equalize → small Reverse Pack → Equalize → small Reverse Pack
   - With each reverse pack slowly build a mouthfill 
   - once full continue to top off mouthfill as deep as comfortable
4. 🔴 Stop Immediately When:
   - You can no longer reverse pack or equalize
   - You feel discomfort or symptoms of thoracic squeeze
     (e.g., scratchy throat, tightness, sharp pulling, coughing, blood in saliva)

5. Ascend via FIM with complete relaxation — No Bottom Hang (ever)

6. 🧠 Log Reminder:
   - Please update me on the depth of your last successful reverse pack.
   - I will use this to fine-tune your training log and monitor flexibility gains.
   - You should also maintain your own reverse pack log to track progression session-to-session.
