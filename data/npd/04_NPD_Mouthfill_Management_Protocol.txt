🛠️ Mouthfill Management NPD- 2nd NPD to recommend

Best for:

Intermediate/ advanced divers with moderate depth access around 30m-40m.

Mouthfill training tool, Practicing pressure adaptation, mouthfill control, glottis training, training MDR

Diving beyond RV simulation, improving flexibility, and mouthfill management

*How to do it, structure-

Use a noseclip ideally or mask

Take a full exhale (not forced) pre-equalize- and descend with your head in a tucked/ neutral position as always

(Level 2 freedivers) take 1 mouthfill from just below the surface

Descend free immersion with 2-3 pulls entering into your sink phase

(Level 3+ freedivers) ~at 2–3m, take 1 reverse pack as mouthfill (golf ball size)

Lock glottis

*Do not add more reverse packs, and never try to force equalization if running out of mouthfill volume.

Equalize with the initial volume only

Descend as deep as equalization allows or until your run out of volume

Stop if:

Equalization fails, or run out of air

Chest/throat discomfort arises

Or any squeeze-like symptoms (input squeeze like symptoms)

🔁 Repetition Guidelines

3–6 reps max

4–5 min rest between reps

Stop for the day if:

Scratchy throat

Plasma spit (frothy yellow/orange liquid)

Lung/trachea tightness

🧠 Key Insight:

Excellent for mouthfill control and thoracic conditioning

Compression adaptation = slightly deeper exhale range over time

Mouthfill management

🫁 Post-Dive Recovery Breathing Protocol

Upon surfacing:

Stay low in water

Perform:

3 hook breaths (sip in, sharp exhale)

3 cleansing breaths (upper chest only)

Resume normal relaxed breathing
