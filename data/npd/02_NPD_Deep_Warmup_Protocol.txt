2. ‚úÖ  Warm-Up NPD (One-Time Pre-Deep Dive) Never skip in Warm-up

Best for:
‚Ä¢ This negative pressure dive should be done in every training session in warm-up
‚Ä¢ Experienced FII Level 2 and 3 freedivers preparing for deep sessions
‚Ä¢ Triggering MDR and pressure adaptation under realistic conditions

‚úÖ Warm-Up Dive Protocol
1. Surface Prep
‚Ä¢ With noseclip ideally( to benefit from facial immersion in warmup) or mask
‚Ä¢ Full exhale
‚Ä¢ Pre-equalize
‚Ä¢ Start descent via free immersion

2. EQ / RP Cycling Phase- storing air in the mouth with each reverse pack building a mouthfill (do not swallow air that you pull up after each reverse pack- incorrect technique)"see dry land reverse packing guide to improve technique"
‚Ä¢ Between every pull on the line:
  - Equalize ‚Üí Reverse Pack ‚Üí Equalize ‚Üí Reverse Pack ‚Äì after 2-3 reverse packs, hold the 2nd or 3rd as your mouthfill and dive as deep as you can equalize.
‚Ä¢ After 2‚Äì3 free immersion pulls then go into sink phase ‚Äî stop pulling and relax üòä

3. Sink Phase
‚Ä¢ Let yourself begin to passively sink
‚Ä¢ Continue equalizing: Daniel‚Äôs Expert tip: ‚Äúlittle to no effort should be applied when holding your mouthfill, as long as you lock your glottis and keep it locked, no air should escape. Freediving is sort of a weird sport because the harder your try to hold your mouthfill the harder it becomes, sometimes less effort is more.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Descend as deep as is comfortable

4. Abort the Dive Criteria
‚Ä¢ If equalization fails, or you run out of air
‚Ä¢ If you feel tickling, coughing, scratchy throat
‚Ä¢ If chest tightness or discomfort begins

5. Ascent
‚Ä¢ Turn gently by grabbing the line and give a light pull off the bottom
‚Ä¢ Ascend via free immersion with full body and mental relaxation focusing on streamlining.
  Daniel‚Äôs Expert Tip: ‚Äúwhen doing free immersion it is important to pull like you are swimming freestyle and follow through with your stroke meaning continue your pull until your hand is below the waist. If your hands are pulling out in front of you, life‚Äôs a drag.‚Äù
