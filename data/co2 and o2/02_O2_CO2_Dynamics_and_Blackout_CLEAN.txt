2. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Dynamics:

Oxygen Depletion:

During a dive, blood oxygen levels decrease, and carbon dioxide levels increase.

Drive:

The increasing CO2 triggers the urge to breathe (the ).

While the oxygen drive (the feeling of needing oxygen) also exists, the CO2 drive is typically the dominant factor causing the urge to breathe but needs to be tamed by elite freedivers.

If oxygen levels drop too low, a blackout (loss of consciousness) can occur as the body shuts down non-essential functions to conserve oxygen.

But we can blackout from being too low on O2, being to High on CO2, being to low on CO2, and certain levels to high O2 is poisonous to us. So there is a certain balance we are playing inside the body to stay out of the extremes of one or the other.

While less of a concern in freediving than in scuba diving, nitrogen can also cause decompression illness (the bends) upon ascent if nitrogen has dissolved into the tissues at depth. In freediving we can get type to decompression sickness which effects brain and spinal cord, which is more dangerous than the type 1 dcs in scuba diving which effects the joints. And it is due to the mdr and blood shunt as the blood is centralized in your body core area. While doing one deep freedive can result in DCS as you dive day to day its rare due to of gassing on pure O2 after the dive. It also depends on the flexibility of individual and lung operation. As someone with less plasma fill will off gas nitrogen faster than someone with a squeeze or strong plasma fill. So it is more dangerous for freedivers. The people who get dcs the most are freedivers diving 25m-40+m repeatedly without a proper surface interval. Rule of thumb on surface intervals. Dive shallower than 25m double your dive time, Dive deeper than 25m minimum 8 minutes on the surface, dive beyond 40m 12 minutes on the surface with 5 minutes of O2 if possible, dives beyond 60m, 16 minutes with 5minutes of O2.

4. Other Physiological Adaptations and Risks:

Training Effects: Freediving training can improve breath-hold comfort and tolerance to hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide). A long breath hold is built into every individual but if you can’t stay relaxed through contractions/ hypercapnia it will be difficult for you to use the breath hold already built into you.

Risk of Shallow Water Blackout: This can occur when divers ascend with low oxygen levels, potentially leading to loss of consciousness.
