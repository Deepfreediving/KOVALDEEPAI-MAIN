CORE LOGIC- BASIC FREEDIVING EQUIPMENT
1. Low-Volume Freediving Mask
🔹 What it is:
A specialized mask designed with minimal internal air space. Like the Aqualung Sphera
🔹 Benefits:
Less air required to equalize as you descend (critical for deeper dives).
Reduces mask squeeze by maintaining internal pressure with minimal effort and the sphere is one of the lowest volume masks on the market and it’s the most flexible with plastic lenses and frame so everything flexes.
Improves visibility due to a closer lens-to-eye distance and wider field of view, however the sphere has curved plastic lenses that don’t magnify underneath the water, but you have peripheral vision, lenses can scratch over time is a downfall.
Streamlined design lowers drag during ascent/descent.
🔹 Pro Tips:
Ready to go out of the box, using spit as antifog for your mask should be good enough. One of the biggest gimmicks is store bought antifog as it is the same as no tears baby shampoo but once you use it spit will never work anymore.
If you buy a mask with glass lenses there is a protective film on the lenses that needs to be removed with lighter burning it off or toothpaste will dissolve the film then spit should work.
Test for proper fit by holding to your face without a strap and inhaling gently — it should seal naturally.
🫁 2. Freediving Snorkel (Simple J-tube)
🔹 What it is:
A non-purge, curved tube used to breathe on the surface while keeping the face in the water.
🔹 Benefits:
No purge valve = fewer bubbles, less noise, and more durability, less to fail.
Allows relaxed surface breathing in the snorkel position, key for pre-dive breath-ups.
Simple and streamlined to reduce drag and entanglement risk.
🔹 Pro Tips:
Use a flexible, soft silicone mouthpiece for comfort.
Don’t dive with it in your mouth — spit it out right before the dive to prevent airway block or barotrauma during a blackout.
Attach the snorkel to the back of the mask so its pointing up the highest out of the water when your face is looking down in the water.
🦶 3. Long Blade Freediving Fins- like cetma dynamatecs are Daniel’s favorite
🔹 What they are:
Extra-long fins made from plastic, fiberglass, or carbon fiber that offer efficient propulsion.
🔹 Benefits:
Maximizes propulsion with minimal effort, conserving oxygen.
Reduces lactic acid buildup in legs.
Smooth energy transfer and better bodyline help improve hydrodynamics.
🔹 Material Comparison:
🔹 Pro Tips:
Use cotton socks if chaffing, buy 1-2 sizes smaller than foot size, neoprene socks compress at deepest part of the dive causing you to lose efficiency.
Choose blade stiffness based on body size and strength (softer for lighter divers with long legs, stiffer for shorter divers with thicker legs and more power). 1-4 stiffness is the range.
🧥 4. Open Cell 2-Piece Wetsuit
🔹 What it is:
A wetsuit with an inner lining of raw, sticky neoprene ("open cell") that clings to your skin, typically in two pieces: jacket + pants.
🔹 Benefits:
Superior warmth due to the skin-tight seal (less flushing of cold water).
Increased comfort with better mobility compared to stiff scuba suits.
No zippers = better hydrodynamics and more even insulation.
🔹 Ideal Thickness Guide:
🔹 Pro Tips:
Always use lubricant to put it on (diluted  1 part conditioner 6 parts water or suit lube).
Rinse in freshwater and dry inside-out first, then outside.
Yamamoto #45  is the highest grade neoprene you can buy usually only offered in custom fit suits by doublek  , oceaner, eliosub, molchanov
🧷 5. Rubber Weight Belt
🔹 What it is:
A belt made of rubber or silicone that holds lead weights to fine-tune your buoyancy.
🔹 Benefits:
Maintains buoyancy control throughout the dive.
Stretches around hip bones putting the weight belt lower around your butt or hip bones wont restrict diaphragm breathing, unlike nylon belts that don’t stretch.
Holds weights tightly in place, preventing sliding or shifting.
🔹 Pro Tips:
Always use a quick-release buckle for safety.
Start with neutral buoyancy at 10m — adjust weights accordingly.
Position weights low on hips to help bodyline and streamline posture.
🧲 6. Neck Weight (Optional but Core for Pool Training)
🔹 What it is:
A flexible weight (often silicone-covered) worn around the neck to balance buoyancy in horizontal swimming.
🔹 Benefits:
Keeps body horizontal in pool disciplines like Dynamic (DYN, DNF).
Reduces effort to stay streamlined, improving overall glide and oxygen efficiency.
🔹 Pro Tips:
Adjust weight based on suit buoyancy, lung volume, and pool depth.
Avoid using in open water — it can hinder emergency floatation unless used carefully with a coach.
Freediving Wetsuits: Advanced Considerations
Closed-Cell Neoprene in Recreational Freediving and Spearfishing:
Closed-cell neoprene is often used on the outside of recreational freediving suits because it adds durability and strength while maintaining flexibility. This makes the suit less fragile and more resistant to abrasions, which is particularly beneficial for activities like spearfishing, where contact with rocks, reefs, or other underwater structures is common.
For recreational freediving, a suit with open-cell neoprene on the inside and closed-cell neoprene on the outside is the preferred choice. The open-cell interior provides excellent insulation and comfort, while the closed-cell exterior offers protection and durability.
Competitive Freediving Suits:
In competitive freediving, especially in warmer waters, most professional freedivers opt for a 1.5mm suit. These suits are designed with:
Nylon 4000 on the inside: This material provides a balance of comfort and durability while maintaining some flexibility.
Smooth Cell Skin (SCS) on the outside: This is a protective smooth lining that enhances streamlining by reducing drag in the water. The smooth skin exterior allows for more efficient movement through the water, which is critical in competitive settings.
While these suits are slightly more restrictive for breathingcompared to open-cell suits, the thin 1.5mm thickness ensures breathing efficiency is still maintained. The trade-off is the streamlining benefit, which is crucial for competitive performance.
Key Differences Between Recreational and Competitive Suits:
Recreational Freediving/Spearfishing:
Open-cell interior, closed-cell exterior.
Prioritizes durability and warmth for longer dives and rugged environments.
Competitive Freediving:
Nylon 4000 interior, SCS exterior.
Focuses on streamlining and minimal drag for optimal performance in controlled conditions.
Key Takeaway
For recreational freediving and spearfishing, a suit with an open-cell interior and closed-cell exterior is ideal for durability and warmth. In competitive freediving, a 1.5mm suit with Nylon 4000 inside and SCS outside is preferred for its balance of breathing efficiency and reduced drag, making it perfect for streamlined performance in warmer waters.

Maintenance and care always dry your suit inside out the open cell is like tiny little pockets of neoprene that can gather bacteria quickly. I would never recommend people to buy the comp suit in a suit thicker than 1.5mm as it restricts breathing too much. with all equipment always rinse of with fresh water and dry in well ventilated area out of the sun.
Thank you for sharing these important maintenance and care tips! Here's a refined and structured explanation incorporating your points:
Freediving Wetsuit Maintenance and Care
Proper maintenance of your freediving wetsuit is essential to ensure its longevity, hygiene, and performance. Here are the key guidelines:
Drying Your Suit:
Always dry your suit inside out. This is especially important for suits with an open-cell interior, as the tiny pockets of neoprene can trap moisture and bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors and potential degradation of the material.
Once the inside is dry, turn the suit right-side out to dry the exterior.
Cleaning After Use:
After every session, rinse your suit thoroughly with fresh water to remove salt, chlorine, or other contaminants that can damage the neoprene over time.
Avoid using harsh detergents; instead, use a neoprene-safe cleaner if needed.
Drying Environment:
Dry your suit in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to sunlight can degrade the neoprene and reduce its elasticity and durability.
Suit Thickness for Competitive Freediving:
For competitive freediving, it is not recommended to use a suit thicker than 1.5mm. Thicker suits can restrict breathing and reduce overall comfort, which is counterproductive in a performance-focused environment.
General Equipment Care:
Always rinse all freediving equipment (e.g., fins, masks, snorkels) with fresh water after use.
Store your gear in a cool, dry place to prevent damage from heat or humidity.
Key Takeaway
Hygiene: Dry your suit inside out to prevent bacteria buildup, especially in open-cell interiors.
Protection: Rinse with fresh water and avoid direct sunlight to preserve the neoprene.
Suit Selection: For competitive freediving, stick to 1.5mm suits to maintain breathing efficiency and comfort.
