🩺 Freediver Performance Evaluation Criteria – E.N.C.L.O.S.E. Model

(For Koval Deep AI logic and coaching use)

Use this structure to systematically evaluate dive performance. Ask targeted follow-up questions to identify root causes of performance issues or discomfort. Only offer coaching after clear diagnostic understanding.

---

E – Equalization Issues
🔍 Evaluate:
• Did EQ fail at a specific depth?
• Was there tension or discomfort?
• Did you swallow your mouthfill or run out of air?
• Did you reverse pack too early?
• Do you have air but can’t equalize?
• Nose clip or mask issue?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Bad technique (Valsalva reliance, poor Frenzel mechanics)
• Soft palate or glottis tension
• Incorrect mouthfill management
• Sinus congestion or illness
• Cold water or poor head position

✅ Recommendations:
• 100+ daily dry EQ reps only for Level 1 (shirtless, in mirror)
• Review mouthfill mechanics
• Use dry EQ training tools (NPD, reverse packing, mouthfill drills for Level 2+)
• Delay diving if congested or showing sinus squeeze symptoms

---

N – Nitrogen Narcosis (Deep Dives >35m)
🔍 Evaluate:
• Any confusion, tunnel vision, euphoria, or disorientation at depth?
• Did it occur consistently at the same depth?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Dive depth beyond current adaptation
• Fatigue, low O2, or elevated CO2 levels

✅ Recommendations:
• Progress slowly in 2–3m increments
• Dive rested and relaxed
• Increase surface intervals
• Stop progression until symptoms disappear

---

C – CO2 Tolerance (Urge to Breathe, Early Contractions)
🔍 Evaluate:
• When did contractions start?
• How intense were they?
• Did they disrupt focus or technique?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Poor CO2 tolerance
• Overbreathing
• Mental tension or anxiety
• Inefficient streamlining or finning

✅ Recommendations:
• Dry CO2 tables (1–2x/week max)
• Visualization drills pre-dive
• Urge-to-breathe static hangs
• Improve streamlining and relaxation

---

L – Leg Burn / Muscle Fatigue
🔍 Evaluate:
• Were legs burning early?
• Was finning tense or sloppy?
• Pigeon-toe or bicycle kicking present?
• Was sink phase triggered on time?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Poor finning technique
• Weak legs or low anaerobic capacity
• Inappropriate warm-up
• Improper fins

✅ Recommendations:
• Dynamic apnea sprints
• Anterior tibialis strengthening
• Use smaller training fins if form breaks
• Adjust sink phase timing (kick cycle or alarm)

---

O – O2 Tolerance / Recovery
🔍 Evaluate:
• LMC or blackout?
• Visual disturbances, cyanosis, tingling, dizziness, or euphoria?
• Was recovery slow or incomplete?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Overtraining or dive overreach
• Poor O2 tolerance
• Strained equalization or inefficient descent
• Tension or mental stress

✅ Recommendations:
• Step back 5–10m to rebuild confidence
• Dry O2 tables (1–2x/week max, never with CO2 tables)
• Increase surface intervals and rest days
• Focus on complete hook and recovery breathing

---

S – Squeeze (Trachea / Bronchial / Lung)
🔍 Evaluate:
• Any throat scratch, cough, pain, or blood?
• Was the dive at or beyond RV?
• Cold conditions? Rapid descent?
• Poor MF or head position?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Tense descent, improper reverse pack timing
• Forced EQ under pressure
• Soft palate lift or mouthfill loss
• Mask squeeze, core tension, lack of flexibility

✅ Recommendations:
• Rest 1–2 weeks if blood is present
• Restart at half depth and progress slowly
• Fix head and MF technique (don’t lift chin)
• Build flexibility with NPDs and MDR warm-ups

---

E – Equipment & Gear Issues
🔍 Evaluate:
• Mask leaks, fogging, pressure?
• Wetsuit too tight or compressing chest?
• Fins too soft or stiff?
• Weight belt sliding or pulling?

🛠️ Possible Causes:
• Ill-fitting wetsuit or mask
• Improper neck weight distribution
• Mismatched fin stiffness to dive style

✅ Recommendations:
• Refit wetsuit and adjust thickness for water temp
• Use silicone belt to reduce slippage
• Replace or modify fins as needed
• Rebalance weight for 10m neutral buoyancy

🧠 Why It Works
E.N.C.L.O.S.E. helps “enclose” the root causes of performance issues. Each letter is a diagnostic category to wrap structure around analysis.

🗣️ Coaching Phrases:
“Let’s enclose the weaknesses from this dive and address them.”
“Before moving forward, we need to enclose all the factors affecting your performance.”
“Each dive should be enclosed by clarity, not confusion.”
