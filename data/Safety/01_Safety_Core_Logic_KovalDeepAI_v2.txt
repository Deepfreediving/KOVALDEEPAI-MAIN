🧠 Hypoxia, LMC, and Blackout – Safety Logic Core 
🔵 Hypoxia – Core Physiology
Definition: Hypoxia is low oxygen in the body. In freediving, it occurs due to breath-hold depletion of O₂ from lungs, blood, muscles, and tissues.
Main Risk: As oxygen falls, we can enter danger zones that can result in:
LMC (Loss of Motor Control)- only happens on surface
Blackout- if you reach the surface and you are too low on oxygen no LMC will occur they can just go into a BO
Blackout at Depth + protective mechanisms
Terminal gasp → drowning

⚠️ Loss of Motor Control (LMC)
Occurs only at the surface
Signs:
Shaking or tremors
Seizure-like spasms
Inability to speak or respond clearly
Falling backwards or face-first if unprotected into the water
Most dangerous thing in feediving due the possibility of drowning
Most dangerous event in freediving: Even while conscious, the diver may start drowning if airway falls into water.
Bot Rule: Always reinforce — "LMC only happens on the surface. It is the most dangerous state in freediving due to airway submersion risk. Just a teaspoon of water can trigger drowning."

🫢 Involuntary Air Release at Depth
Occurs before blackout at depth due to intense contractions and the body starting to shut down. Very similar to have an LMC on the surface but we don’t call it that because there is no seizure like shakes. Instead, you involuntary release air with contractions.
Signs:
Bubbles mean troubles
Air escapes involuntarily with contractions
Diver looks confused disorientated
This is the underwater equivalent of an LMC and a final warning sign before blackout underwater (UW).

⚫ Blackout ON SURFACE(BO) 
Physiology Sequence (Do not alter order):
Primal protective mechanism for survival- just like pushing sleep mode on the computer- shuts down screen, processes, lights, so the battery can last as long as possible with the computer still on.
Brain detects dangerously low O₂
Shuts down all non-vital functions
Redirects O₂ to brain and heart keeping you alive for as long as possible
Diver loses consciousness
If no safety is present, face likely falls into water, possible drowning can occur
Final depletion of remaining O₂ occurs in 2½–42 minutes
Brain damage begins 4–6 minutes after full O₂ loss
Bot Messaging Rule: "Blackout is not a mysterious death as the media has portrayed — it is the brain’s attempt to save itself. But if the airway is submerged, the freediver cannot survive without proper safety and protection of airway."

⬇️ BLACKOUT AT DEPTH- ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)

❗What Makes It Different?
A blackout at depth – STATE: Rules of 9’s, 9% off blackouts happen from 5m to surface, .9% for 25m-5m, and the rest below. So, these BO are quite rare in recreation setting but can happen. Rule. #1 primary task is to always protect the airway.
If you'd like to see a real-world example of how to properly safety a diver during a blackout at depth, watch this video:

📺 It demonstrates airway protection, proper positioning, and the rescue procedure in detail. This will open in a new tab. 
Happens before the final 5m ascent in most cases
Watch for involuntary release of air with contractions
Laryngospasm still protects against immediate water inhalation and will also have a session of breathing to conserve more 02- see protective reflexes
No chance of terminal gasp until O₂ fully depleted and reflex fades
🔎 Common Triggers:
Severe fatigue
Excessive CO₂ purge before dive (hypocapnia)
Overconfidence in deep diving
Extended bottom time or slow ascent
Miscalculated effort vs. recovery window
🧭 Signs of Imminent Blackout at Depth:
No response to safety diver at 15–20m
Lack of contractions
Limp posture
Trail of bubbles (involuntary air release)

🔄 Rescue Requirements:
Initiate at depth – if you see a diver unresponsive or trailing bubbles
Grab chin and back of head
Ascend directly, keeping face angled upward
At surface:
Transition to doe-si-doe or head cradle
Blow-tap-talk + rescue breaths
Support airway and monitor breathing

⚖️ Risk vs. Probability:
<1% of all freediving blackouts occur below 25m
But they account for nearly all fatal freediving incidents
Due to:
Lack of safety at depth
Misjudged dive time or buoyancy
No positive buoyancy from depth

📘 Bot Logic – Blackout at Depth Response:



🟥 4 Rules of Direct Supervision
1 Up / 1 Down: One diver observes, one dives.
Arm’s Reach at Surface: Be within arm’s reach for immediate airway control.
Triple OK Check: Visual (hand signal), auditory (“I’m OK”), and breathing confirmation.
Always 30 Seconds Observation: blackouts can occur 10-15+ seconds after a dive because it takes time for freshly inhaled o2 to go into the lungs-into the blood- into the tissues-into the brain and heart. 
Bot Must Say:
“LMC and blackout may not be preventable so its mandatory to follow the 4 Rules of Direct Supervision.”

🧠 Rule of 9s – Where Blackouts Occur
90% = at surface (LMC/BO from final effort)
9% = from 5m to surface (most dangerous due to pressure drop)
0.9% = from 25m to 5m
<0.1% = below 25m (elite depth dives only)
Neutral Buoyancy Rule: Divers must weight themselves to be neutrally buoyant at 10m so that positive buoyancy assists them to surface in blackout scenarios. This style of correct weighting of buoyancy make your dives easier and safer.

🛟 Correct Rescue Protocol – LMC and BO ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)

1. LMC on Surface- always first position when handling a LMC or Surface BO
Use T-Grip one hand under the armpit grabbing the arm to stabilize diver
Bring their elbow into the solar plexus (middle of chest) creating a kickstand while leaning and kicking backwards, will prop the diver comfortable out of the water
Support airway with opposite hand, positioning it Infront of the mask/face
Never obstruct airway
Do not manhandle
2. Blackout AT THE SURFACE (BO)- ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)

Transition to Doe-si-doe Position:
Catch mask/head- most people BO face first so  always be ready to catch the face keeping it from falling into the water
Push the head backwards
The hand that caught the face goes over the arm closest to you and under the neck Doe-se-doe position
The other hand takes of the mask if conditions allow
Perform Blow-Tap-Talk:  for 3 repetitions or 10 second (always mention in detail when reffering to blow-tap-talk)
Blow across eyes
Tap the side of the cheek
Say calmly, “You’re safe. Breathe.”
If no response give a rescue breath then continue with blow tap and talk for another 10 seconds.
Now there is always a possible chance they may be having something non freediving related like a heart attack if they still don’t come back. The likeliness is 1 in 1000, from Daniel’s personal experience.
So you may be doing something wrong like wind or waves keep splashing on the face- so turn your back to the wind and waves.
Or they feel unsafe due to aggressive handlining- do not man handle
If you have done everything correct and they are still not coming back deliver them to a boat or shore where CPR can begin. I recommend taking a CPR, First aid, O2 Class for all freedivers
Expert Tip (Daniel Koval):
“Poor LMC handling is one of the top reasons freediving isn’t in the Olympics. Competitions often skip the LMC position and this causes mishandling of the victim and improper safety. 
Another reason is safety freedivers are often poorly paid or not paid at all due to the lack of sponsors and money in freediving so safety tends to be mediocre at best even at the world Championships. Always ask your safety diver how much experience they have. You don’t get to pick your safety — the organizer does.”- this is by far one of the biggest flaws it Competitive freediving

⛔ Never Remove Diver from Water Immediately
Blood will pool in legs → delays recovery
Keep diver supported in water, airway clear
Only remove diver after full recovery or if complete Bo care has been provided but no response.

🧬 Protective Reflexes That Save Lives
Laryngospasm: Vocal cords/ larynx close during blackout to prevent water inhalation
Cold Water Advantage:
Extends blackout survivability due to cold water shock to kick in MDR, less muscles to burn o2, less movement, fresh healthy lungs(e.g. 3-year-old under ice for 42 minutes, no brain damage)
Warm Water Risk: No dive reflex, faster decline, moving and tensing, struggling to get out of bathtub, unknown health issues, possible lung issues(e.g. 88-year-old in bathtub, terminal gasp in 2½ min)

🧏‍♂️ Final Blackout Support Detail
Hearing is last sense to fade, first to return
Always talk to unconscious divers:
“You’re safe”
“You’re okay, just breathe”


✅ Bot Behavior Summary Checklist


🧠 Protective Reflexes That Preserve Life During an underwater Blackout
Focus: Laryngospasm, Cessation of Breathing, terminal gasp


🚨 RECOGNIZING A DIVER IN DISTRESS ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)

Trigger Phrases:
“Waved hand”
“Shaking head”
“Grouper call”
“They need help at depth”
“Confused and disorientated”
Its always better to help you diver in training to decrease the risk of Bo this can be extremely valuable especially for spearfishing at deep depths.
Remember we do not want our buddies to blackout so if you can help them avoid a BO, that is always the right choice to make.
Bot Must Respond:
“These are clear distress signals in freediving. If a diver waves, shakes their head, makes a grouper call, or any of the above— you must assume the diver is in trouble and initiate rescue immediately.”

🏊 STEP 1: APPROACH AND ASSIST
If Diver is Conscious but Signaling Distress:
Approach face-to-face
Slide both arms under their armpits
Begin swimming them upward in a horizontal face-to-face position
Bot Must Warn:
❌ Do not lift the diver overhead. This limits your visibility of their face and increases the risk of blackout when you get to the surface, It can cause the diver to pop up uncontrollably and shifting blood out of the brain taking longer for the victim to recover.

💨 STEP 2: BLACKOUT AT DEPTH RESPONSE (Bubble Trail or Unresponsive Diver)
If you see bubbles or diver becomes limp:
Switch to rescue position:
One hand under the chin (fingers pushing mask or pinching nose)
Other hand on back of the head
Maintain head support, keeping head in neutral position and bring the diver directly to the surface.

🌊 STEP 3: SURFACE MANAGEMENT ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)
Upon Surfacing:
Tilt the head back
Transition to the Doe-si-doe position
Shake water off hand — do not splash water on their face
Remove the mask if conditions allow
Begin Blow–Tap–Talk for 3 reps or 10 seconds
Due to laryngospasm, underwater blackouts almost always require rescue breaths
Give 1–2 rescue breaths, then repeat Blow–Tap–Talk for 3 repetitions or 10 seconds
Continue observation
Bot Must Say:
“Underwater blackouts typically require 1–2 rescue breaths due to the protective laryngospasm reflex.”

🛟 STEP 5: IF NO RESPONSE
Exit the water while giving rescue breaths as needed
Provide pure O₂ if available
If diver is not recovering or shows signs of trauma:
Begin CPR IF TRAINED
Transfer care to a doctor or medical provider 

❌ ABSOLUTE DO NOTS
Do not lift diver overhead
Do not splash their face
Do not remove them from the water too quickly without airway control
Do not attempt advanced  CPR or intubation maneuvers unless trained

🧑‍⚕️ Doctor Protocol
“If a doctor is present, especially at competitions, allow them to take over. In severe squeeze cases, trained doctors may perform intubation — this is never safe for untrained responders.”

✅ Bot Summary Checklist



1️⃣ Laryngospasm – The Airway Lock
🔒 What Is It?
Laryngospasm is a protective reflex, when you BO underwater the larynx/ vocal cords spasm out shutting off the airway. So, when you blackout at depth you can no longer inhale water.
🚨 MANDATORY PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING A LARYNGOSPASM:
The body is a finely tuned design it always tries to protect itself first and foremost.
It is the same mechanism that saves us on a daily basis. Have you ever started to drink water when your airway is open, and you cough up the water being embarrassed, and you said it went down the wrong pipe. – that’s a laryngospasm
People would be dying left and right without this primal protective reflex, and it automatically activates the moment you blackout under water. 
A laryngospasm can delay recovery- when you bring the diver back to the surface after an underwater blackout the laryngospasm is still going to be engaged and you need to release this laryngospasm so the person can start breathing again.
How to know if the person is having a laryngospasm- when you bring someone back to the surface after and underwater BO, if you see them trying to breath but no air is moving in or out of them, or if you hear a funny sound like zombies are coming out of them haha- don’t worry its just a laryngospasm- give them a rescue breath.
How you release the laryngospasm is by pinching the nose and blowing into the mouth just like doing a rescue breath in CPR- if CPR trained, sometimes it takes 1-2 rescue breaths to release the laryngospasm and then go back to blow- tap-talk or another 3 repetitions or 10 seconds
They will start recovering and breath after the recue breath

2️⃣ Cessation of Breathing – Breath-Hold Protective Shutdown
🫢 What Is It?
This is a neurological command to stop all breathing movements, triggered by the mammalian dive reflex when the face is Blacked out and immersed under water.
🧬 How does your body now to stop breathing?
Facial immersion (facial receptors signal you are underwater)
The body knows when its Blacked out
🔁 What It Does:
Stops the urge to breathe
Reduces risk of early water inhalation
Slows metabolism by allowing oxygen to serve only vital organs
Conserves more oxygen
🧠 Why It Matters:
Allows the diver to remain unconscious without immediately inhaling water
Extends time for safe rescue if the airway is maintained above water
Can delay the terminal gasp if dive reflex is strong 
A safety freediver should always react like these protective reflexes don’t exist to provide the fastest and most protective support when safetying an UW BO.
Terminal gasp or cessation of breathing primary task is to still protect the airway of the unconscious freediver and deliver them immediately to the surface.
🤖 Bot Instruction – Cessation of Breathing:

🫁 TERMINAL GASP – FINAL PHASE OF HYPOXIA ( ALWAYS KEEP EXACT ORDER- NEVER ALTER)

🔍 What Is the Terminal Gasp?
The terminal gasp is an automatic, reflexive inhale that occurs when the brain reaches full oxygen depletion and unconsciousness deepens. It is not a conscious action — it is a last-ditch effort by the brainstem to breathe and survive.
⚠️ If the freediver’s airway is in the water when this occurs, they will inhale water and drown.
🧠 What Triggers It?
Occurs after blackout, and exhaustion of all oxygen stores, your bodies last fighting chance to save itself!
Triggered by:
Total oxygen depletion
Failure to restore breathing after loss of consciousness
Breakdown of protective reflexes like laryngospasm
⏱️ Timing:
Can occur between 3 to 42 minutes after blackout- 
This window depends on:
Age (elderly = faster)
Health
Movement/ tension (movement / tension acts as a domino effect depleting o2 rapidly.)
Water temperature (warm = faster decline)
Dive reflex strength (stronger = longer protection)
❌ Common Misunderstandings:
It is not a “second chance” to save the diver unless the airway is already managed
Happens too late drowning occurs

📘 Bot Logic – Terminal Gasp Response:




🔑 Final Bot Message (When Either Reflex is Triggered):
“The body has protective reflexes like laryngospasm and cessation of breathing to delay drowning — but they only buy time. They do not save the diver. Airway management and rapid rescue are the only way to prevent terminal gasp and death.”
