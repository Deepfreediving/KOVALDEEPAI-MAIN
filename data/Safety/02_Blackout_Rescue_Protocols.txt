When you lock the glottis, you are closing off the airway at the level of the vocal cords. This is essential for techniques like mouthfill, where you need to trap air in the mouth and throat while keeping the lungs sealed off.

Let's improve this- hypoxia refers to a low level of oxygen and people experience a low level of oxygen playing pretty much any other sport where they are breathing heavily. They are breathing heavily because there body was not able to keep up with the demand of O2 being used so they are in O2 debt and when they stop exercising they will continue to breath heavily trying to repay the O2 back into their bodies. we can store O2 in our lungs, blood, tissues, and muscles so we can experience various degrees of being long on O2. So when we are holding our breath if we hold our breath for too long or burn too much o2 we can actually have a loss of motor control LMC, near blackout or samba- terms all mean the same, an LMC is when you have reached a low enough level where the body has started the shut process I call it a grey area, as the body has started the shutdown process but if they make it to the surface they will have a seizure like shake or loose motor control while still conscious. I believe it’s the most dangerous thing in freediving because it is very easy for the airway to fall into the water and inhale water. all it takes is a teaspoon of water in your lungs for you to start drowning. A LMC only happens on the surface however when the body loses consciousness at depth, we usually see an involuntary release of air with contractions- usually the number 1 sign of someone about to lose consciousness. The contractions are so big, and they are so low on o2 that the person is no longer able to keep the air into them, so they are basically having an lmc underneath the water but we call it an involuntary release of air with contractions. A blackout is a primal protective mechanism our body uses in order to help us survive. As we black out our body shunts down the non-vital functions that we don't need for survival and direct o2 in the most vital functions brain and heart keeping us alive for as long as possible. We cannot stay blacked out forever as we are still burning o2 so once we deplete all the o2 in our bodies we have 1 last fighting chance to save ourselves. we will take a terminal gasp or final breath. if we are still face down in the water we will inhale water and then 4-6 minutes after that is when the first irreversible signs of brain damage occur.

Why It’s Dangerous: LMC typically happens at the surface. If the airway falls into the water during this state, even a small amount of water (as little as a teaspoon) can lead to drowning.

Risk of Drowning: LMC or blackout can cause the airway to submerge, leading to water inhalation.

Surface Protocols: Ensure proper recovery breathing at the surface to avoid LMC or samba.

when you black out underwater you have protective reflexes, a laryngospasm which causes the larynx/ vocal cords to close, so know they can no longer inhale water when they are blacked out underneath the water. when you save the person your release it by giving a rescue breath after getting them into the dosey-doe position and doing 3 blowing across the eyes, tapping the cheek and telling them to breath or for ten seconds. if no response give 1-2 rescue breaths to release the laryngospasm then continue with blow tap and talk and should always come out of the black out. if blacked out underwater the will also have a cessation of breathing because the body knows when its blacked out underwater due to facial receptors around the face, most sensitive ones are around the eye, the reason why you want to blow across the eyes when saving a blackout because it initiates a breathing response and tells the body it is no longer underwater so it can breath

The information you’ve shared highlights some important aspects of the body's protective reflexes during underwater blackouts and the rescue process. Here's a structured explanation based on the concepts you mentioned:

Rescue Process for Underwater Blackout

Place the person in the dosey-doe position (a safe and effective position for rescue).

Perform blow-tap-talk:

Administer 1-2 rescue breaths to help release the laryngospasm. This can help open the airway and allow the person to start breathing again.

Continue with blow-tap-talk for about 10 seconds to encourage a natural breathing response.

Rescue Breaths: These are essential if the laryngospasm does not release on its own.

Thank you for sharing that important detail! Indeed, hearing is often the last sense to fade during a blackout (BO) and the first to return upon regaining consciousness. This makes talking to the person during a rescue crucial for several reasons:

Why Talking is Important During a Blackout Rescue

Practical Application in Rescue

During the blow-tap-talk process, the "talk" component is not just a formality—it plays a vital role in the rescue.

safety first statement is incorrect removing them from the water will cause all the blood to go into the legs making it take much longer to wake up from the blackout so keeping them in the water is better. the primary task when handling and LMC or BO is protecting the airway and keeping it out of the water and clear for air exchange.

Primary Task: Protect the Airway

The most critical priority during a blackout or LMC is to ensure the person's airway is protected and kept clear of water to allow for air exchange.

This means always keeping their face above the water to prevent water from entering the airway.

Instead, keep the person floating in the water in a supported position while managing their airway and performing rescue techniques.

Rescue Techniques

Use the blow-tap-talk method:

If necessary, administer 1-2 rescue breaths to help release a laryngospasm and initiate breathing.

The primary focus during a blackout or LMC is airway managementand ensuring the person can breathe. Keeping them in the water, supported and with their face above the surface, is the best approach to facilitate recovery.

for saving a LMC on the surface we get them in the T-grip one hand underneath the persons armpit bring them close into your chest leaning and kicking sightly backwards while the other hand protects their airway keeping your hand infront of the face making sure not to close airway so they can breath. The dosey-doe position, so if the diver Blacks out BO, the diver catches the face/ mask and pushes they head back keeping the airway out of the water. The hand that pushes the head back then goes over the persons arm closes to the diver and under the neck cradling the head lifting it up to keep the head above the waves and face dry, the other hand takes off the mask if conditions allow and blows taps and talks. Safetying a diver in distress the safety diver grabs the diver under the armpits face to face watching for any bubbles. if you see bubbles signifying BO, change positions by putting palm of the hand under the chin, fingers pushing the mask or pinching the nose, other hand on the back of the head cradle the head and bring them straight to the surface where you put the head back and go into the dosey doe position.

Thank you for providing such a detailed explanation of the rescue techniques for handling a Loss of Motor Control (LMC) or Blackout (BO) during freediving. Here's a structured summary of the correct rescue procedures based on your input:

Rescue Techniques for LMC and BO

Use your other hand to protect their airway, keeping it in front of their face to ensure it remains clear for breathing. Be careful not to obstruct the airway.

If the diver blacks out, immediately catch their face/mask with one hand and gently push their head back to keep the airway out of the water.

Perform the blow-tap-talk method:

Transition to a rescue position:

Bring the diver straight to the surface while maintaining control of their airway.

Transition into the dosey-doe position to ensure the airway remains clear and the face stays dry.

Airway Protection is Paramount: Always prioritize keeping the diver's airway clear and their face above the water.

Blow-Tap-Talk: This method is essential for stimulating breathing and reassuring the diver during recovery.

Mask Removal: Only remove the mask if conditions allow, as it can help protect the airway in rough water.

I trained you on this information if you can please review as you wrote this to me earlier- The information you’ve shared highlights some important aspects of the body's protective reflexes during underwater blackouts and the rescue process. Here's a structured explanation based on the concepts you mentioned:

The body recognizes it is underwater through facial receptors, particularly those around the eyes. These receptors are part of the mammalian dive reflex, which helps conserve oxygen by slowing the heart rate and reducing oxygen consumption.
Breathing stops as part of this reflex, but it can resume once the body is removed from the water and the laryngospasm is addressed.
Rescue Process for Underwater Blackout

Place the person in the dosey-doe position (a safe and effective position for rescue).
Perform blow-tap-talk:
Blow across the eyes: This stimulates the facial receptors and signals the body that it is no longer underwater, encouraging a breathing response.
Tap the cheek: Provides additional stimulation to wake the person.
Talk to them: Reassure and instruct them to breathe.
If No Immediate Response:

Administer 1-2 rescue breaths to help release the laryngospasm. This can help open the airway and allow the person to start breathing again.
Continue with blow-tap-talk for about 10 seconds to encourage a natural breathing response.
Outcome:

Blowing Across the Eyes: This is a critical step as it activates the facial receptors, signaling the body that it is safe to breathe again.
Rescue Breaths: These are essential if the laryngospasm does not release on its own.
Safety First: Always ensure the person is safely removed from the water and monitored closely after a blackout.

In the context of underwater blackouts, the laryngospasm can be addressed during the rescue process by performing specific steps, such as administering rescue breaths, which can help release the spasm and reopen the airway.
