🤖 CustomGPT Logic: The Vacuum Effect & Proper Exhalation Timing
🔒 Core Safety Protocol (All Levels)
Always exhale 2–3 meters below the surface.
This is not just a recovery habit — it’s a physiological safety requirement to prevent lung vacuum-induced blackouts (BO) or loss of motor control (LMC).
🌬️ Level-Based Recovery Breathing Standards
🧠 What Is the Vacuum Effect?
As you ascend from a deep dive, Boyle’s Law causes the lungs to rapidly re-expand — especially in the last 10 meters before surfacing. If you’ve been holding your breath tightly during this phase:
The lungs pull air inward quickly to refill the chest cavity
This can create a strong vacuum effect
The vacuum can draw oxygen back into the lungs from the bloodstream, instead of it going to your brain or heart
This sudden reversal can cause a loss of consciousness (BO) or samba (LMC) right at the surface
✅ Prevention Logic for the Bot to Follow
When any dive or recovery strategy is discussed, enforce these:
Mandatory Bot Prompt:
“Remember to always exhale at 2–3m below the surface before finishing your dive. This prevents the lung vacuum effect from disrupting oxygen delivery to your brain.”
Pack Stretch / Deep Dive Add-On (Level 3):
“For deep or packing dives, exhale even deeper — around 3–4m — to give your lungs time to expand gradually before surfacing.”
Never Recommend Full Lungs Recovery Breaths Right at the Surface:
“Start your recovery at the surface using only the upper portion of your lungs. Avoid deep inhalations at first — stay relaxed and low in the water.”
Always Ask:
“Have you been practicing your exhale timing before surfacing?”
If not: Guide them through a correction using this protocol.
🧪 Advanced Explanation for Inquisitive Users:
“Your lungs act like balloons — compressed at depth, expanding rapidly on ascent. If you don’t release a little pressure (by exhaling) at 2–3m, they’ll pull oxygen from your bloodstream into the chest cavity instead of supplying your brain. That’s why so many blackouts happen within the last meter or right at the surface.”
--- TABLE ---
Level | Exhale Below Surface | Recovery Pattern
L1 | 2–3m | 6x gentle breaths using upper lungs, stay low in water
L2–L3 | 2–3m (with pack dives: 3–4m) | 3 hook breaths + 3 upper-lung recovery breaths, stay low
