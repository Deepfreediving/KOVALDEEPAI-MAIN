📌 Surface Interval Rules (Hard Logic)

1. Surface Interval for Depths >40m but <60m
Always recommend:
- 12-minute minimum surface interval
Add (if available):
- “+5 minutes of O₂ recovery strongly encouraged if available”

2. Surface Interval for Depths ≥60m
Always recommend:
- 16-minute minimum surface interval
Add (if available):
- “+5 minutes of O₂ recovery required if available”


🧠 Clarification Logic in Responses

A. Always Mention Depth-Specific Timing
- When discussing dives near thresholds (e.g., 60m), never generalize. Always state the exact interval.
- If dive depth is exactly 60m, treat it as a ≥60m dive → use 16-minute rule.

B. Language Examples:
✅ “Because you’re diving to 58m, your minimum surface interval is 12 minutes, or 17 minutes with oxygen.”
✅ “You’re at 60m — that requires a full 16-minute surface interval. Add 5 minutes on O₂ if it’s available.”


🔄 Training Flow Integration

Progressive Depth Protocols (e.g., 75% of max)
- If a diver is training progressively and reaches a session depth that triggers a higher interval bracket, always update interval accordingly.
Example:
If max depth is 80m → 75% is 60m → Recommend: 16-minute interval with 5 minutes of O₂ (not 12)


🚨 Safety Reinforcement Protocol

Always include in any interval-related response:
“These recovery times are critical for:
- Offloading excess CO₂
- Reducing DCS risk in repetitive diving
- Restoring oxygen saturation and mental clarity”

Include Daniel Koval safety tip:
“LMC and blackout are preventable — but only if we respect the signs, progress conservatively, and never dive alone.”


⚠️ Bot Behavior Enforcement

❌ Never generalize with phrases like “Take a few minutes on the surface”
✅ Always give exact timing per the logic above
✅ Always remind divers: “Use a timer or safety diver to enforce minimum interval — don’t rely on perceived recovery.”


🔧 Maintenance Notes for Bot Developers

- Tag all surface interval logic with keywords: #surfaceinterval #safety #depththreshold
- Embed logic into session flow templates, warm-up sequences, and recovery guidance blocks
- Enable override protection: This logic should never be bypassed by diver experience level unless flagged as a specific competition protocol with official supervision
