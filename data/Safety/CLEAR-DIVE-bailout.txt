# CLEAR DIVE — Bailout Triggers

> ⚠️ **Safety First**
>
> - If it's not a CLEAR DIVE, BAIL OUT immediately.
> - Never chase a depth when safety signals are present.
> - Trust your body's warnings over ego or targets.

## The CLEAR DIVE Rule

**C.L.E.A.R. D.I.V.E.** — Each letter represents a critical safety checkpoint. If ANY of these conditions occur, abort the dive immediately:

### **C** — Contractions Too Early

- Contractions before 1/3 of planned dive time
- Unexpected or intense urge to breathe
- **Action**: Abort and log the issue

### **L** — Leg Burn on Descent

- Premature muscle fatigue during descent phase
- Anaerobic shift robs brain of O₂
- **Action**: Abort immediately

### **E** — Equalization Fails

- Unable to equalize at expected cadence
- Pain or blockage in ears/sinuses
- **Action**: Turn around (forcing EQ risks mouthfill loss & squeeze)

### **A** — Any O₂ Symptoms

- Tunnel vision, stars, euphoria
- Visual disturbances or cognitive changes
- **Action**: Abort immediately

### **R** — Rising Doubts/Distraction

- Mental uncertainty or loss of focus
- Equipment concerns or environmental changes
- **Action**: Abort and reassess

---

### **D** — Discomfort Chest/Throat

- Any squeeze signs (scratch, pain, pressure)
- Throat irritation or chest tightness
- **Action**: Abort immediately, rest 24-48h if severe

### **I** — Impairment from Narcosis

- Confusion, disorientation, poor judgment
- Depth-related cognitive changes
- **Action**: Turn at onset depth, note for future planning

### **V** — Vision Distortion

- Any visual changes or disturbances
- Pre-syncope warning sign
- **Action**: Abort (critical safety hazard)

### **E** — Equipment Malfunction

- Mask leaks, weight shifts, gear issues
- Any equipment that affects safety or performance
- **Action**: Abort, surface, regain full control

## Instructor Teaching Cue

**"If the dive's not CLEAR, don't go DEEP."**

## Implementation Notes

- Practice CLEAR DIVE assessment during every training dive
- Brief dive partners on your abort signals
- Log aborted dives to identify patterns
- Never shame athletes for aborting — celebrate safety-first decisions

## Recovery Protocol

After any CLEAR DIVE abort:

1. Complete normal surface protocol
2. Rest appropriate interval (minimum 2x normal)
3. Assess what triggered the abort
4. Modify plan or end session if multiple triggers occur
5. Log incident with specific trigger details

Remember: An aborted dive is a successful dive if it prevents injury.
