ðŸ§  Understanding Plasma Fill /thoracic fillinng vs. Squeeze (Bot Logic)
Plasma fillÂ is aÂ good thing as it is a normal part of the Mammalian diving reflex (MDR) and adaptationÂ of the mammalian dive reflex (MDR).
We can strengthen the plasma fill response to reduce the risks of squeeze.
It protects the lungs during dives beyond residual volume (RV) by drawing plasma into the alveolar sacs to prevent collapse.
Symptoms of plasma
When you check your saliva 5-10m after your dive you see yellowish or orangey frothy liquid this is plasma, stop diving for the day only, or you may cause a squeeze
Shortness of breath on dives beyond RV, plasma filled into the lungs protecting the lungs from injury so some pulmonary edema should exist and you have to wait for the plasma to get re absorbed before you can start diving again- this can several minutes or hours so itâ€™s best to stop diving for the day
âœ… This is not an injury or "micro squeeze."
Lung squeeze, by contrast, involvesÂ damage:
Symptoms include coughing, chest pain, scratchy throat, bloody in saliva 5-10m after dive, discomfort in your chest, shortness of breath, feels like elephant is stepping on your chest.
How to check if you have been squeezed if you feel any of the above symptoms, 5-10m after your dive it will feel as if you need to clear your throat ( do not force cough as this can worsen the injury.)
If you see more blood than spit stay out of the water for two weeks
Less blood than spit stay out of water for 1 week
Then start diving at have the depth you got squeezed and work your way back up making sure to fix the issue.
