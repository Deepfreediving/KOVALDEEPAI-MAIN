🧠 Issue: Mouthfill Taken at 25–30m Is Full, Yet Diver Runs Out of Volume by 70m
Symptoms:
Diver takes a full mouthfill between 25–30m.
Equalization works through the mid-portion of the dive.
Around 65–80m, diver runs out of air despite no apparent swallowing or early release.
Equalization becomes difficult or impossible near the bottom.
Diagnosis:
This is not a volume size issue — it is almost always a volume management problem. There are three primary root causes:
Overuse of air in the 35–55m range.
Diver is leaking small amounts during each equalization.
Glottis may be partially open or unlocked between equalizations- due to head position to tucked, or slightly lifted due to neckweight.
Relaxation is lost, leading to inefficient pressure distribution.
Mouthfill not locked properly.
Glottis isn't fully sealed between equalizations.
Soft palate instability causes micro-leaks (not always perceived as swallowing).
Mouthfill timing and phase management error.
Diver takes mouthfill at the correct depth, but starts using it too soon.
Without entering full sink phase (no propulsion), relaxation is incomplete and body tension causes early air usage.
Prescribed Tools:
✅ Tool 4: Progressive Mouthfill Compression with Contractions
Learn to equalize every 2–3 seconds with no air loss for up to 20+ equalizations.
Teaches economy of use and control under increasing pressure.
✅ Tool 3: Reverse Pack + Equalization Timing with Stretch Reflex
Simulates real-time contractions and teaches “equalize only on cue” rhythm.
Builds volume preservation discipline.
✅ Tool 1: Soft Palate and Glottis Control
Reassess if micro-leaks are due to weak glottis lock or incorrect tongue posture.
Run tongue extension test to ensure air is staying in the rear oral cavity.
Behavioral Correction:
Shift glottis philosophy from “tense seal” to calm, elastic lock.
Practice holding the mouthfill for 20–30 seconds before even attempting an equalization.
Evaluate how many equalizations are being used between 30–60m and cut that number down via technique refinement.
Never perform the mouthfill while kicking — enter full sink phase first.
Daniel Koval Tip:
“If your mouthfill is full at 25–30m and still runs out by 70m, you’re not leaking — you’re overusing. Air isn’t vanishing, it’s being wasted. Mouthfill is about preservation, not just size.”
Training Protocol: Deep Mouthfill Top-Off Practice
Purpose:
To gradually improve comfort and control when taking a deeper mouthfill and topping it off at depth, without engaging respiratory muscles or exceeding residual volume (RV) limits.
Step-by-Step Guide:
Preparation:
Ensure you are Level 2 certified or higher.
Perform diaphragm stretches and dry reverse packing exercises daily to improve thoracic flexibility and glottis control.
Begin with a clear goal: gradually shift your mouthfill depth deeper, starting at 22m and progressing incrementally.
Warm-Up Dive:
Perform a few warm-up dives to 15–20m to relax and prepare your body for deeper equalization work.
Focus on maintaining a neutral head position and relaxed body posture throughout the dive.
Initial Mouthfill:
Take your first mouthfill at a depth of 22m or deeper. Never take it shallower than 22m, as this does not effectively train deeper equalization.
Use the 6-step sequence:
Stop propulsion
Enter sink phase
Drop arms (optional)
Relax
Equalize
Take 1–2 large reverse packs to isolate the mouthfill.
Top-Off Practice:
After isolating the initial mouthfill, continue descending and attempt to top off your mouthfill at progressively deeper depths (e.g., 25m, 28m, 30m).
Add small amounts of air to your mouthfill without engaging your respiratory muscles or creating tension in your glottis or soft palate.
Focus on keeping your glottis locked and your body relaxed during each top-off.
Monitor for Issues:
If you find yourself swallowing air during the top-off, stop and surface to reset. This indicates improper glottis control or tension in the soft palate.
Avoid engaging your respiratory muscles (e.g., diaphragm or intercostals) when topping off, as this can disrupt relaxation and air isolation.
If you feel tension or strain, reduce the depth of your top-off and focus on relaxation before attempting again.
Depth Progression:
Gradually increase the depth of your top-off over multiple sessions, but never attempt to top off past your RV depth(typically 40–50m, depending on your flexibility and experience).
Aim to take your final top-off 5–10m shallower than your RV depth to ensure safety and comfort.
Post-Dive Review:
After each dive, assess your performance:
Did you successfully isolate and hold the mouthfill without swallowing or losing air?
Were you able to top off without engaging respiratory muscles or creating tension?
How comfortable did you feel with the deeper top-off?
Common Issues and Solutions:
Swallowing Air: 
Focus on locking your glottis and relaxing your soft palate. Practice dry glottis control exercises to build muscle memory.
Tension in Glottis or Soft Palate: 
Perform relaxation drills before diving and ensure you are not rushing the top-off process.
Engaging Respiratory Muscles: 
Concentrate on isolating the air in your mouth and avoid any movement in your chest or diaphragm during the top-off.
Safety Notes:
Never attempt mouthfill training or top-off practice beyond your RV depth.
Always dive with a trained safety buddy and follow proper safety protocols.
If you experience discomfort, tension, or difficulty maintaining control, stop the dive and review your technique.
