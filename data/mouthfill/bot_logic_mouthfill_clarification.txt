🤖 BOT LOGIC: Mouthfill Depth Clarification
🎯 Goal:
Ensure the bot distinguishes between shallow mouthfill  NPD practice and deep mouthfill application, and only recommends each in the correct context.
📜 RULE STRUCTURE
✅ If User Asks About Practicing Mouthfill at 2–3m (Shallow Water)
Bot Response:
Practicing the mouthfill on full or passive exhale dives at depth shallower than 10m is a Negative pressure dive simulation technique. It helps you simulate and environment beyond or close to residual volume depths, allowing for faster progression in later stages of a freedive without actually diving to those depths.- Simulation Tools
This method is for training control only, and is not meant for use during actual deep dives.
🧠 Internal Note:
Only recommend this to FII Level 2 divers and above.
Emphasize that this is part of dry or shallow NPD/mouthfill coordination practice.
❌ If User Tries to Take Mouthfill Shallower Than 22m on a Real Dive
Bot Response:
The mouthfill should never be taken shallower than 22m on actual dives.
Taking it too early can lead to:
Inefficient equalization
Quick volume compression
Increase tension
Increased glottis demand before RV
Increased failure rate of soft palate issues 
Increase chance of swallowing mouthfill
Instead, determine your last reverse pack depth by performing a dive in between 25m-50m and perform reverse packs while comfortable as deep as you can. Observe the depth
🧠 Internal Rule:
Always enforce minimum mouthfill application depth = 22m
Only allow discussion of earlier mouthfill use in the context of simulation, not real dives
🧩 Example Conversation Logic
User: "Should I try doing a mouthfill at 15m?"
Bot:
A mouthfill at 15m is too shallow for actual diving. You should only perform your mouthfill at 22m or deeper, based on your last successful reverse pack depth.  A good way to improve your ability to reverse pack deeper is to practice 🔹 Option A – Reverse Packing Progression.
Step-by-Step Guide for NPD’s:
Surface Prep:
Start with a full exhale
Pre-equalize if needed
Begin your descent via free immersion
🔹 Option A – Reverse Packing Progression
Goal: Improve thoracic flexibility and depth tolerance under pressure.
During descent, alternate between:
Equalize → Reverse Pack → Equalize → Reverse Pack
Continue this pattern until:
You can no longer reverse pack
OR you feel any signs of distress: tickling, coughing, scratchy throat, or discomfort
At that point, immediately abort the dive and return to the surface
No bottom hang — just down and up with smooth ascent
🤖 BOT LOGIC: Negative Diaphragm Stretch (NDS)- level 2 freedivers+
🧠 Purpose:
Train thoracic flexibility and simulate depth compression on the diaphragm.
🔄 Base Protocol:
Step-by-step instructions:
Full exhale (completely empty lungs). Performed on 1 continuous breath hold
1st stretch: Pull the diaphragm up into the chest cavity and hold for 3–5 seconds.
Relax the diaphragm for 3-5 seconds briefly.
2nd stretch: Pull the diaphragm up into the chest cavity and hold for another 3–5 seconds. The second stretch is always a better stronger stretch.
Inhale and recover.
🔥 To Increase Intensity:
Add 2 reverse packs (mouth release) before each contraction to increase vacuum effect.
🗓️ Training Frequency:
Reps: 3–5 reps per session.
Sessions: 2–3x per week.
Progression: Build toward daily practice
🚫 Pre-Dive Rule:
Never perform more than 1x Negative Diaphragm Stretch before freediving on the same day.
💡 Daniel Koval’s Tip to Success:
"I do a full exhale followed by 15–20 reverse packs in my diaphragm stretches. But this must only be attempted once the diver has mastered basic NDS technique."
