ðŸ”Š Soft Palate Locking During Sink Phase: Solutions for Intermediate Freedivers
Problem:Â During the sink phase, the soft palate can unintentionally close, blocking airflow and preventing equalization.
Fix Strategy:
Master Frenzel & Glottis/Soft Palate Separation
Practice nasal vs oral airflow to identify soft palate movement.
When exhaling try to switch between exhaling out the mouth and nose as quickly as possible to gain control of the soft palate and to recognize the movement and difference between the soft palate and glottis.
Practice glottis lock separately: inhale, open mouth, try to exhale without releasing air.
Another tool (dry land) Breath up for 1 minute
Using nose clip or pinching nose- hold your breath with the mouth open for up to 2 minutes
 As you start getting contraction try to equalize without opening glottis. 
Build control over each independently.
Train with Full Exhalation + Reverse Packing
Begin with full exhale.
Perform 2-3 reverse packs to simulate compression.
Hold the final reverse pack as a "mouthfill."
Equalize while maintaining a locked glottis.
Goal: No air escapes. If air disappears, glottis is likely not locked.
See stretch receptor + reverse packing guide for complete details on training tool- Rules update guide
Simulate Stretch Receptor Contractions
Do same as above
After reverse packs, hold until 3-5 diaphragm contractions.
Equalize in between contractions to simulate deep dive pressure.
Practice timing and glottis control.
Use a Nose Clip (Optional Progression)
Once comfortable, repeat above with aÂ looseÂ nose clip.
Air will slowly leak from nose, simulating decreasing mouthfill.
Train to manage full mouthfill lifecycle under pressure.
Do NOT Overtrain
Limit this drill to 8-10 reps per session.
Max 4-5 contractions per hold.
Always prioritize form and glottis lock, not max breath-hold.
