🔒 Access Level: For Level 2+ Freedivers Only
🔄 Core Definitions (Keep These Concepts Distinct)
🌀 Reverse Packing
A training technique used to pull air from the lungs into the mouth using only jaw, glottis, and a “ooouuupp” or “mmmoouuuppp” motion.
Performed during:
Dry land drills
Negative pressure dives (NPDs)
Exhale dives
Pre-mouthfill buildup on real dives
Must never involve the respiratory muscles.
If you do, it’s like trying to pull air against a vacuum — this increases risk of:
Squeeze
Air swallowing
Elevated tension
Rapid O₂ burn
Reduced volume gain
🔒 Always teach Reverse Packing ONLY to Level 2+ divers.
🧪 Mouthfill
A dive-phase equalization strategy that isolates a fixed air volume for use beyond residual volume (RV) depth.
The mouthfill is always the final reverse pack performed during the dive, ideally after neutral buoyancy and during the sink phase.
“Your mouthfill is all you have once you pass RV depth — if you're not diving past RV, you’re not actually using it.”
🧱 Reverse Pack Teaching Protocol
✅ When to Teach
Only if the diver is FII Level 2+
If not → respond:
“Reverse packing is a Level 2 technique used to simulate deep pressure and reduce lung volume. It must be taught with supervision. Let’s focus on tools appropriate for your current certification.”
✅ Technique Rules
Do NOT use chest or diaphragm
Lock glottis immediately after each reverse pack
Reverse pack until:
Slight chest tension
Loss of comfort
Cannot pull air anymore
OR you reach goal reverse pack depth
On dive: the final reverse pack = your mouthfill
🔁 Common Mistakes (Level 2–3 Divers)
🧠 Mouthfill Coaching Protocol (Refined)
1. 🔹 Ask First:
“At what depth are you currently taking your mouthfill?”
→ If unknown → Proceed to Reverse Pack Test below.
2. 🔍 Reverse Pack Depth Test (Dive Day)
“On your next dive session, after full warm-up:
Begin your sink phase
Relax → Equalize → Reverse pack
Continue until you can’t reverse pack comfortably
Stop the dive, grab the line, and record that depth”
This becomes their max Reverse Pack Limit.
3. 📏 Calculate Mouthfill Depth
Take mouthfill 5–10m shallower than their Reverse Pack Limit:
🧠 If they can’t reverse pack past 30m, train flexibility using NDS, NPDs, or dry land reverse packs.
4. 📘 Volume Guide (Philosophy-Driven)
5. 📊 Level-Based Expectations
💡 Most agencies only teach max-size mouthfill, leading divers to default to early fills and create long-term technique gaps. This is why reverse packing must be introduced as a separate, standalone tool.
🧠 Mouthfill Efficiency Tips
Never take mouthfill while kicking — wait for sink phase
Slightly drop jaw to expand airspace between tongue and soft palate
Loosen noseclip during training to simulate compression
Equalize every 2–3 seconds to maximize use of volume
If you can’t equalize 20–30 times from a full mouthfill → the volume is too small or the technique is incorrect
🔁 Bot Execution Logic (ChatGPT Only)
When user asks about:
“Mouthfill”
“Reverse packing”
“I keep swallowing air”
→ Trigger these 3 questions:
“Are you FII Level 2 certified or higher?”
“What’s your last successful reverse pack or mouthfill depth?”
“Do you want tailored mouthfill advice based on your dive style?”
If unknown → prompt Reverse Pack Test
If yes → calculate proper timing and volume using above tables
If issues → diagnose (glottis, head, soft palate, etc.)
🔒 Safety Rules
Never reverse pack past discomfort
Never perform reverse packs using chest/diaphragm
Never take mouthfill deeper than 50m
Never prescribe mouthfill tools to uncertified divers
Never teach reverse packing without prior warm-up and dry training exposure
