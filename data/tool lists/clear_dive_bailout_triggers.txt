✅ PROPOSED NEW ACRONYM: “CLEAR DIVE”
🧠 Meaning:
If it’s not a CLEAR DIVE, then it’s time to BAIL OUT.
🔠 C.L.E.A.R. D.I.V.E. – Smart Bailout Trigger Acronym
| D | Discomfort in Chest or Throat | Tickle, pain, or compression = early squeeze signs. Abort immediately. |
| I | Impairment from Narcosis | Mental fog, euphoria, or odd visuals = turn at onset depth. |
| V | Vision Distortion / Visual Triggers | Blurry vision, dark haze = on verge of hypoxic shutdown. Abort. |
| E | Equipment Malfunction | Flooded mask, dropped noseclip, fogged vision = abort. You're not fully in control. |
🧠 Instructor Cue:
“If the dive’s not CLEAR, don’t go DEEP.”
🤿 Bonus Teaching Tips for Students:
Use "CLEAR" during pre-dive checklist.
Use "DIVE" during post-dive debrief to recall if anything came up that should have triggered an earlier abort.
Have them rate how “CLEAR” their dive felt (0–5) after each session for safety journaling.
🔻 ENHANCED BAILOUT TRIGGERS WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION
🧠 Daniel Koval’s Tip:
“We never push through warning signs — we diagnose them. Every aborted dive is a lesson. Every bailout is a step forward in awareness.”
--- TABLE ---
Letter | Trigger | Explanation (Why Bail Out)
C | Contractions Too Early | Before 1/3 of planned time = poor warm-up or CO₂ buildup too fast. Abort and log.
L | Leg Burn on Descent | Early anaerobic shift → reduces brain O₂ availability. Abort to avoid blackout risk.
E | Equalization Fails | If you can’t equalize — you turn. Forcing = glottis fatigue, MF loss, squeeze risk.
A | Any O₂ Symptoms | Tunnel vision, stars, dizziness = you’re already hypoxic. Abort and signal.
R | Rising Doubts or Distraction | If focus breaks, body tension rises. Abort to prevent spiraling into failure.

🚨 TRIGGER | 🔬 WHY YOU MUST BAIL OUT
1. Gear Malfunction | ⛔ Mask flood or loss of noseclip → inability to inhale fully or equalize. Increases stress, elevates heart rate, reduces dive efficiency. Risk of laryngospasm, early contractions, or hypoxic cascade.
2. Unexpected/Early Contractions | ⛔ Contractions < 1/3 of planned dive signal untriggered MDR or poor recovery. Push through = high risk of hypercapnia blackout. Must BAIL to prevent pushing into anaerobic exhaustion.
3. Throat or Chest Discomfort | ⛔ Tickle, pain, or discomfort = potential pulmonary barotrauma, early signs of squeeze. Squeeze risk increases exponentially if ignored. Abort immediately.
4. Burning Legs on Descent | ⛔ Indicates anaerobic stress onset before O₂ conservation has peaked. Legs pulling blood → lowers brain O₂. Abort if burning begins on the way down.
5. Doubts / Tension / Distraction | ⛔ Psychological tension triggers glottis fatigue, soft palate issues, and increases O₂ use. Mental state is your first line of defense. Bail if mind is not calm.
6. Any O₂ Symptoms on Descent | ⛔ Seeing stars, tunnel vision, loss of motor control → already in hypoxic zone. Continue = blackout highly likely before surface. Bail, signal buddy, and surface.
7. Nitrogen Narcosis Symptoms | ⛔ Confusion, euphoria, or delayed motor control = early narcosis. You may feel "fine," but judgment is impaired. Turn at depth of onset until adaptive threshold is raised over time.
8. Equalization Problems | ⛔ Rule: If you can’t equalize, you TURN. Never descend deeper to fix it. Doing so with tight glottis or loss of MF = airway under pressure, high risk of deep blackout or throat squeeze.
9. Fusion of Doubt + Tightness | ⛔ Combination of psychological hesitation + neck or shoulder tightness = high-stress zone. Elevated CO₂, tense thoracic cavity, impaired flexibility = abort. Common in cold-to-warm transition dives.
