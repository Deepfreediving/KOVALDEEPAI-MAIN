⚠️ Environment:
Dry land only.
Never perform this in water, including shallow pools.
Must be performed lying flat on your back, not sitting or standing.
Glottis and Soft Palate Control:
access level: "Level 2 and above"
purpose: >
Develop independent control of the glottis and soft palate to improve mouthfill
retention and prevent accidental swallowing during equalization. These tool targets
the root cause of premature mouthfill loss and trains unconscious motor coordination.
core concepts:
Equalization occurs behind the soft palate.
Swallowing the mouthfill is often caused by the soft palate and glottis moving together.
Proper technique requires keeping the glottis locked while maintaining a neutral soft palate.
Mouthfill is held in the back of the mouth, the jaw is lowered and the tip of the tongue extremely lightly keeps pressure to hold air in the back of the mouth.
Proper Frenzel maneuver does not use the cheeks to equalize
Step-by-Step Drills:
Isolate Nose-to-Mouth Airflow (Soft Palate Awareness):
description: >
Practice switching airflow between nose and mouth while holding your breath.
instructions:
Attempt to exhale slowly through the mouth, then switch and exhale through the nose.
Go back and forth as quickly as possible.
You should feel and hear a clicking sound in the back of your throat as the soft palate lifts up and down.
Purpose: Learn to consciously feel the soft palate lifting (nose) vs. lowering (mouth).
Identify the Glottis Lock:
description: >
Learn to recognize and control your glottis — your body's main air valve that separates the lungs from mouth and sinuses.
instructions:
Hold your breath with your mouth open.
You should feel a "valve" closing at the back of your throat — this is your glottis.
Exhale  or inhale gently through the mouth, then stop the air with your throat (not your lips).
Practice quick opens and closes — this should become automatic.
Glottis Control with Neutral Soft Palate: Strengthening and Improving Frenzel Maneuver
description: >
Train glottis closure while the soft palate remains neutral — critical for preventing mouthfill loss.
instructions:
Hold your breath with mouth open.
Stick your tongue out as far as possible.
While keeping the tongue extended, perform 5–10 equalizations.
Analysis:
If your tongue retracts each time, it's pushing on your soft palate — this is a red flag.
It means every time you equalize the tongue pushes on your soft palate which moves the soft palate, the soft palate and glottis move together, so your glottis is likely opening with each effort.
Goal: Tongue stays extended, glottis locked, equalization occurs cleanly without volume loss. This will allow much stronger pressured equalizations with much less effort.
Fixing Cheek fill- Extremely bad habit and hard to fix requires constant practice:
description: >
Air stored in the cheeks leads to tongue-soft palate contact and airflow blockage.
symptoms:
Difficulty equalizing despite full mouth.
Sudden "gulp" swallowing during effort.
explanation: >
When your mouthfill is stored in the front of mouth/ cheeks the tongue puffs up in the back and presses against the soft palate, it will trap air in front of the palate. This causes a vacuum behind it as you equalize and volume decreases behind the soft palate. When the pressure becomes too great or volume diminishes forming a vacuum behind the soft palate, and the diver attempts to equalize, they won’t be able to shift the air backwards causing the mouthfill is swallowed in one large gulp.
Key- “Primary issue for level 2-3 freedivers learning how to go beyond RV depths- Stretch receptor Contractions increase this challenge causing the diver to tense up or contract.”
solution:
Keep air centralized in the middle and back of the mouth.
Relax cheeks, drop jaw slightly, and the tip of the tongue should extremely lightly push air towards the back of the mouth/ throat where you equalize storing air on top of the soft palate helping to close.
Avoid puffing up cheeks, which in essence puffs up the tongue into roof of mouth.
Suggested Usage:
2–3x per week as dry training
Best used alongside mouthfill and reverse packing sessions
Monitor for involuntary movements (tongue retracting, cheeks puffing) and correct accordingly
Common Mistakes:
Holding air in cheeks instead of mouth center
Letting tongue press against soft palate
Not locking glottis after each reverse pack
Daniel Koval Tip:
"If your tongue pulls back or your cheeks puff, your soft palate will move — and your glottis will open. That’s how your mouthfill disappears. Train your airway like a muscle. Precision and relaxation always win."
Building Mouthfill exercise
description: >
train your reverse packs to be able to build your mouthfill with small reverse packs and increase glottis efficiency and locking speed.
Take Full exhale and start with 3-4 reverse packs exhaling the air out your mouth with each reverse pack- To increase difficulty add more reverse packs as option
Once a slight vacuum that has been created in your lungs
Reverse pack 1 time and hold 2-3 seconds, reverse packing again adding to initial reverse packing volume, making sure not swallow, by locking glottis after each reverse pack and hold 2-3 seconds, repeat RP and hold.
After 5 reverse packs you should have the max amount volume any one person can fit in their mouth which signifies a full mouthfill, and hold.
Start to equalize until 2-3 stretch receptor contractions come on making sure that glottis stays locked.
Inhale
🛠️ Simulated Depth Training: Full Exhale + Reverse Packing
✅ Exercise Format (on dry land): use nose clip or pinched nose
Start with a full exhale.
Perform 3-4 reverse packs. - to increase difficulty, add more reverse packs by +2
Hold the last reverse pack as your mouthfill. - If stretch receptor contractions do not start with in 30 seconds increase reverse packs.
Begin equalizing while holding this volume.
Your goal: Practice timing equalizations in between stretch receptor contractions while keeping the glottis locked.
No air should escape the mouth during this phase. If it does, the glottis isn’t sealed and you will swallow air with each equalization leaving you with an empty mouth.
Common issue:” people confuse locking the soft palate and tongue together as a glottis lock- if the air is stored in the front of your mouth and cheeks you are likely locking the soft palate and not the glottis.”- see Fixing Cheek fill
🔁 To increase difficulty:
Add more reverse packs (not more breath-hold time).
Focus on glottis control by increasing the vacuum in the lungs.
🔄 Progressive Mouthfill Compression + stretch receptor contractions
**Only recommend if - Simulated Depth Training: Full Exhale + Reverse Packing has been mastered on at least 10 RP difficulty**
Loosen the nose clip slightly and perform the same reverse pack training.
With each equalization, a small amount of air escapes—mimicking how your mouthfill shrinks during an actual dive.
Equalize every 2-3 seconds finding a rhythm. Stretch receptor contractions will start soon.
Your goal: Mouthfill Management, Maintain efficiency and air management trying to achieve at least 20–30 equalizations while dealing with stretch receptor contractions until mouthfill is depleted.
If air vanishes too quickly:
You may be locking the soft palate instead of the glottis.
You may be swallowing air due to incorrect coordination.
5. 🧠 Key Takeaways
Your mouthfill is your final reverse pack before residual volume.
Train glottis lock and tongue compression during contractions.
Always prioritize technique over duration. This is not a breath hold tool its and equalization tool so holding your breath hold longer and longer will defeat the purpose of the tool.
Never overtrain—perform 4-6 reps/ sets max per session with 2-minute rests.
⚠️ Safety Reminder
Only train this tool on dry land.
