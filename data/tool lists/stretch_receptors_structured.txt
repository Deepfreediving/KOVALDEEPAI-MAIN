💡 What Are Stretch Receptor Contractions?
When the lungs are stretched beyond what they’re used to, the body triggers a natural reflex:
Over-inhaling creates pressure → signals the urge to exhale
Full exhaling or reverse packing (to reach residual volume) → triggers the urge to inhale
These urges are called stretch receptor contractions.
🫁 During a Freedive
At residual volume depth, freedivers commonly feel 1–2 contractions.
If they tense up, it often leads to problems:
Swallowing the mouthfill
Locking the soft palate or tongue
Air shifting to the cheeks, disrupting equalization
Ongoing contractions that increase risk of lung or bronchial squeezes
❗ This is one of the most challenging parts of a dive for most freedivers.
If the diver stays calm and relaxed, these contractions usually go away. This allows them to:
Keep equalizing beyond RV depth
Focus on managing their mouthfill as it shrinks

When to do it:
After stretching in the morning or before bed
Never right before a dive session
🔧 Exercise Steps
Lie down on your back with a tight nose clip.
Do a short breathe-up (1–2 min) to relax.
Do a full exhale and then reverse pack 2–4 times.
➤ No need to force the exhale—just remove more air with reverse packs.
On your last reverse pack, hold it like a mouthfill.
Equalize every 2–3 seconds while holding your breath.
➤ There’s no pressure change, so mouthfill volume should stay constant.
Wait for stretch receptor contractions (they should come quickly).
➤ If not within 30 sec, add more reverse packs next time.
Keep equalizing through 4–5 contractions, then breathe.
Rest 1 min. On the next round, add 2 more reverse packs.
Repeat 6-8 repetitions in total. Increase reverse packs each time until:
You hit full RV depletion
Or reverse packing becomes too difficult
Stop if you feel any discomfort: coughing, scratchy throat, tickling in chest/throat.

🛠 Bonus Tool: Mouthfill Depletion Challenge
Once you’ve mastered locking the glottis and keeping air from escaping into the lungs:
Slightly loosen the nose clip
Each time you equalize, small amounts of air escape
Goal: manage the shrinking mouthfill and still equalize consistently
✅ A well-managed mouthfill should give you 30+ equalizations before running out of air
