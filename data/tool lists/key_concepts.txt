✅ Key concepts

🔹 Reverse Pack Depth
Key Concept: The deeper you can comfortably reverse pack, the deeper you can dive with a stable mouthfill.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“Try to reverse pack deeper during your sink phase — but always stay above your residual volume limit.”
“As your reverse pack becomes more comfortable at depth, your ability to equalize deeper will improve.”

🔹 Mouthfill Size
Key Concept: Slightly increasing mouthfill size gives you more air to equalize at depth — as long as technique and glottis lock remain strong.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“Consider taking a slightly larger mouthfill if you’re running out of air early during the dive.”
“Only increase mouthfill size if you can hold it comfortably and avoid soft palate tension.”

🔹 Leg Burn
Key Concept: Burning legs indicate poor technique or excessive drag. Fixing posture reduces effort.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“If your legs are burning, check your technique — keep your legs straight and kick from the hips.”
“Avoid kicking from the knees or shoulders. Stay streamlined and relaxed.”

🔹 Mouthfill Relaxation Priority
Key Concept: Don’t rush into your mouthfill — relaxation first, then air management.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“Don’t take your mouthfill based on an alarm — focus on feeling fully relaxed first.”
“Turn off mouthfill depth alarms and replace them with a relaxation alarm. When it goes off: drop your arms, relax, equalize, then mouthfill.”
Daniel Koval Tip: “It doesn’t matter what depth you take your mouthfill — it matters whether you’re relaxed when you take it.”

🔹 Falling Behind on Equalization
Key Concept: Many divers lose the mouthfill not from size but because they fall behind on equalizations.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“If you’re falling behind on equalizations, shift focus away from ‘holding’ the mouthfill — focus on staying ahead.”
“This will reduce tension and help prevent air swallowing caused by soft palate pressure.”

🔹 Mouthfill Disappears Quickly
Key Concept: Poor glottis lock often results from head position.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“Try adjusting your head position — instead of tucking down, pull slightly back to create a ‘double chin.’”
“You should feel a firm glottis lock in the throat — this helps prevent mouthfill loss.”

🔹 Depth Alarms
Key Concept: Too many alarms create anticipation and prevent true relaxation.
Bot Phrasing Examples:
“Avoid overusing depth alarms — they can keep your nervous system too alert.”
“Instead, use just three: one for entering sink phase, and two for 10m and 5m before the plate to cue your bottom turn.”
