🏋️‍♂️ BOT GUIDE: Gym Workout 1 — Lactate Threshold Training
Type: High-Intensity Anaerobic Conditioning
Max Frequency: 1x per week
Duration: 30–45 minutes
⚠️ Rule:
This session should be logged as a high-intensity training session and should not be repeated more than once per week to avoid overtraining and fatigue.
🔁 Warm-Up Phase
Stretching Warm-Up:
→ Full-body dynamic stretches, focusing on legs and lower back.
Light Cardio Warm-Up (5–10 minutes):
Stairmaster: Light climbing pace
Bike: Easy spin at low resistance
Goal: Raise heart rate gradually.
🔥 Main Workout (30 Minutes Total)
Phase 1 (10 min @ 70–75% Max Heart Rate)
Increase resistance to a moderate gear or level
Cadence should be medium to high — burning legs but manageable
Sustain for 10 minutes without dropping cadence
Phase 2 (10 min @ 80–85% Max Heart Rate)
Increase intensity by 2 notches/gears
Legs will be burning — this is your lactate threshold zone
Cadence should slightly drop, but must remain stable throughout the 10 minutes
Phase 3 (10 min @ 70–75% Max Heart Rate)
Reduce resistance by 2 notches/gears
Return to original cadence from Phase 1
Body should feel relief but still experience mild burning → this trains lactate tolerance
🧊 Cool-Down Phase
Spin or light climb for 5–10 minutes to flush out lactic acid
End with light static stretching focused on legs (quads, hamstrings, calves)
🏋️ BOT GUIDE: Gym Workout 2 — Fat Burn + Strength Training
Type: Low–Medium Intensity
Max Frequency: 2–4x per week (based on recovery)
🕓 Morning Fasted Cardio (Pre-Breakfast)
Medium–fast walk for 20–40 minutes
Performed on an empty stomach → body is already in fat-burning mode
Purpose: Maximize fat oxidation and spike metabolism early
🔁 Stretch & Refuel
Light full-body stretch
Eat a balanced breakfast after walk and stretch
🏋️‍♀️ Strength Training (Later in the Day)
Perform your weight training program from your gym coach
Maintain moderate intensity — avoid max effort lifts unless specifically programmed
End with stretching focused on muscle groups used during the session
🧠 Bot Notes:
Always track training intensity (high vs. low/medium) to avoid stacking multiple intense sessions too closely.
This format helps freedivers balance gym load with in-water sessions without risking overtraining.
🏊 BOT MODULE: Pool & Strength Training System
🧠 SESSION CATEGORIES
The bot must categorize each training day by primary focus:
1️⃣   Technique Focus: “Kick & Pull Drill” (No Fins Only)
Purpose: Improve stroke/kick isolation, balance, glide, and streamline
Max Frequency: 2–3x per week (ideal warm-up set)
Instructions:
Perform these drills without fins to isolate movement:
25m frog kick only – no arms
25m arm pulls only – no kick
25m dolphin kick only – no fins
Breath-up:  1 min between each rep
Repeat Cycle: 4–5 total rounds
Warning - Training TOOL only for level 3+ freedivers
2️⃣  Dive Time Simulation Drills (Monofin or Bi-fins)- Warning- Must Have Safety freediver to attempt tool! *Ask: “Do you have a safety freediver for pool workouts- if answer is yes and only yes, apply them with this training tool.”
Purpose: Improve depth simulation, workload under contractions, Co2 and O₂ tolerance
Max Frequency: 1x/week
Tools: Monofin OR Bifins (never both on same day)
🔁 Monofin Protocol
25m slow dynamic apnea swim
At wall: Hold a static for 1–2 minutes (must feel at least 3-4 contractions before return)
On same breath, dynamic apnea returns 25m.
6 recovery breaths with upper lungs off gassing co2.
If you want to increase the challenge -  50m or 75m return
Total dive time: 2:30–3:00 max
Repeat 6–7 reps
3:00 recovery between reps
Notes:
Focus: Kicking through contractions
Increase return distance only if 50m becomes easy
Do not combine with sprints or no-fins work
🔁 Bi-fins Variation
Follow same format, but expect shorter dive time (aim for ~2:30 total)
Return swim: 25–50m only
Maintain consistent rhythm and glide
Focus on mimicking dive speed slightly slower, but streamlined
3️⃣ Sprint Training (When Not Doing Simulations)
Purpose: Improve technique, speed, power, and CO₂ tolerance
Tools: Monofin (recommended)
Monofin Sprint Protocol:
50m sprints
Focus on:
Arm/head streamline
Kick from shoulders, no knee bend
Equal power in front and back kick
Breath-up: Short rests to build mild CO₂ tolerance
Bonus: Use sprints to improve kicking technique, streamlining, and technique efficiency as tiredness sets in- focus on feeling where you feel the most water drag on your body and improve technique.
4️⃣ No Fins Focus – Glide & Stroke Efficiency
Purpose: Master rhythm, glide, and transitions
Instructions:
Perform 25–50m repeats
Focus on:
Smooth frog kick + streamlined arm recovery
Maximize glide after each pull
Avoid rushing transitions (glide before pull / kick)
Count strokes — aim for fewer strokes each rep
Key Tip: Good transitions = efficient no-fins technique. Quality > distance.
5️⃣ 💪 Strength Training (Gym)- (Tailored for no-fins only)
Type: High-intensity strength + cardio
Max Frequency: 1x/week only
Strength Block:
Legs:
Squats, leg lifts, weighted lunges, leg press
3 sets of 10 reps each
Upper Body:
Arm pull-down, lat pull-down
3 sets of 10 reps each
Conditioning Block:
Stairmaster @ 70–80% HR for 20 min
Cool down: 5 min easy pace
Post-Workout Recovery:
Full stretching routine
Include: Packing stretches + Negative diaphragm stretches
6️⃣ 🔻 End of Pool Session: NPD (Optional, Level 2+ Only)
Do 3-5x Negative Pressure Dive (NPD) increasing reverse packs after each rep-at end of pool session
NPD must follow your mouthfill and reverse pack logic
Do not perform if fatigued or experiencing any throat/airway irritation
*Bot-Please explain how NPD’s are done in the pool*
🚨 BOT SAFETY RULES
Respect all training frequency limits
Remind diver: Always train with a buddy
Never push to exhaustion
Stay with in hypoxia limits
Stop all if you do not feel well or feel hypoxic symptoms
