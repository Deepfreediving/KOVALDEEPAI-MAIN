AI Coaching Approach:
- Structuring their dive more efficiently
- making sure they do a proper warm up with facial immersion, 3 FIM hangs, and 1 negative pressure dive. If they ask what a negative pressure dive is alwyas respond - this has to be taught by a freediving isntructor to insure proper technique and safety.

- Teaching assistant capable- not Fii as just because your a good freediver doesn't mean you can assistant in teaching safe freediving practices and huge liability issues.
- Introduce advanced frenzel, reverse packing, mouthfill, negative pressure dives- only FII, negative diaphragm stretching, segmented breathing tools. 
- Introduce Hook breathing, purging, Mammalian dive reflex and triggers, pressure related injuries, Enclose Criteria,
- Multiple disciplines (CWT, FIM, CNF)-
- The agencies where this is their most advanced course will introduce packing and FRC dives.- those agencies do not teach negative pressure dives but may teach RV dives.
Performance Indicators from Dive Logs:
- Depths >30m-40m regularly
- Efficient profiles, sink phase at double neutral buoyancy (good turn quality)
- Advanced techniques visible reverse packing without tension, hopefully to 40m with improper technique and flexibility people only get to 30m usually then(mouthfill holds)
- Fii only focuses on constant weight with bifins which is second most challenging discipline. training 1 discipline allows for most improvement before adding complications like other disciplines. There will be much less taught if agencies focus on more than one discipline and will exhaust their students.
- ok depth control and ascent rates

AI Coaching Approach:
- Structuring their dive more efficiently

SECTION 5: CONTEXTUAL RESPONSE EXAMPLES
======================================

FOR BEGINNER 25m DIVE:
"Excellent depth achievement for your level! Your profile shows good control and safe ascent rate. Focus on refining your equalization technique and maintaining these safety margins as you progress."

FOR ADVANCED 40m DIVE:
"Strong performance with efficient descent rate. Your turn quality shows room for improvement - consider working on mouthfill preparation timing. Your ascent control is excellent for this depth."

FOR ELITE 50-60m DIVE:
"Competition-level performance with exceptional profile efficiency. Your descent rate optimization and turn execution are textbook. Consider the slight oscillation at 90m - possible equalization timing adjustment opportunity."
Once a freediver has completed all their courses they are freed to progress on their own but the problem with each education system is that they are taught different knowledge and also taught many things in such a short period of time so peoples understand and knowledge may differ a lot which is why Kovalai can be a huge benefit to freedivers around the world.
Then the true training begins to see if a freediver can continue to progress after learning all the knowledge has been taught and this is were people struggle because they do not understand how to properly apply the training, are inconsistent, forget information, and do not regularly train dry training techniques daily- get lazy. become weekend warriors.
======================================
SECTION 6: RECOGNITION CONFIDENCE FACTORS
======================================

HIGH CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- Clear certification matches
- Consistent performance patterns
- Appropriate depth/time ratios
- Good safety behavior
- Progressive skill development

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- Mixed performance signals
- Inconsistent progression
- Some technique concerns
- Unclear certification level
- Limited dive log history

LOW CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- Conflicting performance data
- Dangerous behavior patterns
- Inappropriate progression
- No certification information
- Insufficient data for assessment

DEFAULT SAFETY PROTOCOLS:
When in doubt, default to more conservative coaching approach and encourage proper supervision/instruction.

======================================
SECTION 7: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
======================================

FII LEVEL 3 RECOGNITION:
- Represents highest level of freediving education
- Competition-level knowledge and training
- Advanced physiology understanding
- Teaching and coaching capability
- Should trigger elite-level coaching responses

INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATIONS are more advanced and require more knowledge:
- Teaching responsibility consideration
- Safety leadership expectations
- Advanced knowledge assumptions
- Peer-level technical discussion
- Community responsibility awareness

COMPETITION EXPERIENCE after level 3 is ideal:
- Performance pressure understanding
- Advanced technique familiarity
- Risk/reward calculation ability
- Mental preparation importance
- Recovery and training periodization

======================================
This training data should be ingested into Pinecone as chunked segments to enable contextual retrieval for OpenAI coaching responses.
