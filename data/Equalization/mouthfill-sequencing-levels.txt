# Mouthfill Sequencing — Levels & Timing

> ⚠️ **Safety First**
>
> - Mouthfill training requires supervised progression
> - Never attempt mouthfill without mastering basic Frenzel
> - All mouthfill practice must be done with qualified supervision

## Level Progression

### **Level 1 / Recreational (0-30m)**

- **Focus**: Master Frenzel pacing only
- **No mouthfill** — build automatic equalization habits
- **Cadence**: Dense early EQ pattern
  - 0-10m: 6-7 equalizations
  - 10-20m: 5 equalizations
  - 20-30m: 4 equalizations
- **Key Skills**: Clean entries, consistent descent rate, glottic control

### **Level 2 / Intermediate (30-60m)**

- **Introduce mouthfill at 30-40m** only after Frenzel cadence is automatic
- **Prerequisites**:
  - 50+ clean dives with consistent EQ pacing
  - No equalization failures in shallow water
  - Demonstrated glottic control and soft palate management
- **Training**: Supervised introduction with small volumes (60-80ml)

### **Level 3 / Competitive (45-100m)**

- **Mouthfill depth**: 45-60m
- **Volume**: 80-120ml pocket capacity
- **Critical Skills**:
  - Lock posture (glottis closed, neck neutral)
  - No tongue retraction
  - Glottic lift only for pressure delivery
  - Avoid soft palate lock

### **Elite / Deep Competitive (70-150m+)**

- **Mouthfill depth**: 70-90m (near RV depth for maximum efficiency)
- **Volume**: 120-160ml pocket capacity
- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - Protect pocket above RV depth
  - Strict **no-leak** discipline
  - Micro-dosing for deep equalization
  - Advanced glottic control

## Timing Principles

### Early Mouthfill (Discouraged)

**Why 10-20m mouthfill is premature:**

- Narcosis risk when control isn't stable
- Higher chance of pocket loss
- Less efficient volume usage
- Greater squeeze risk if technique fails

### Optimal Timing Strategy

1. **Master foundation first**: Clean Frenzel to 25-30m
2. **Gradual introduction**: Start mouthfill only when basic skills are automatic
3. **Depth progression**: Increase mouthfill depth as RV depth increases
4. **Volume progression**: Start small (60ml) and build capacity gradually

## Safety Gates

### Prerequisites for Mouthfill Training

- [ ] Consistent Frenzel technique to 30m
- [ ] No equalization struggles in shallow water
- [ ] Demonstrated neck/glottic control
- [ ] Qualified instructor supervision
- [ ] Medical clearance for deep training

### Red Flags (Stop Mouthfill Progression)

- Pocket leaks or sudden pressure loss
- Tongue retraction during equalization
- Soft palate locking (sinus pressure without ear relief)
- Neck extension or poor posture
- Any squeeze symptoms

## Teaching Progression

1. **Dry Training**: Glottic control, pocket formation
2. **Pool Practice**: Inverted mouthfill holds (supervised)
3. **Shallow Depth**: 10-15m technique verification
4. **Progressive Depth**: Gradual increase with volume monitoring
5. **Integration**: Combine with full dive profiles

Remember: **Technique before depth, depth before volume.**
