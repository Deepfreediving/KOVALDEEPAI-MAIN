Freediving — or breath-hold diving — activates powerful adaptations in the human body. These are part of a natural response called the Mammalian Dive Reflex (MDR), designed to conserve oxygen, protect vital organs, and help you adapt to the pressure of the underwater environment. Understanding these responses is crucial for safe, effective training.

⚙️ 1. Mammalian Dive Reflex  (MDR)

🫀 Bradycardia (Slowed Heart Rate)

The heart rate drops, reducing oxygen demand and extending your ability to stay underwater. When non-freedivers immerse themselves in water they can only slow their heart rate down around 7-12%, whereas elite freedivers can slow their heart rate down from 25-50%. Slowest recorded heart rate in human beings is 7-10BPM. As you dive down the heart slows, more as the lungs compress, it leaves more room for the heart to increase is stroke volume, helping us to save even more o2.

💉 Peripheral Vasoconstriction (Blood Shunting)

Blood vessels in the arms and legs constrict, sending more blood to protect vital organs like the brain and heart. This shifts your limbs into an anaerobic mode, burning fuel sources like glucose, ATP, and glycogen instead of oxygen. This is why Daniel Koval is able to dive down to over the length of a football field and back up on 1 single breath of air against and environment 800x more dense than air. Sea water is 800x more dense, this would not be possible without this reflex.

🫁 Thoracic Filling / Plasma FIll

At deep depths (beyond residual volume), the body pulls plasma into the lung alveoli to prevent lung collapse. This adaptation protects the lungs but can lead to pulmonary edema if overtrained, dehydrated, or performed with poor technique. It's a slow-to-train reflex and must be approached conservatively.

⚠️ If you're not rehydrated properly or push too many contractions at depth, you may risk a lung squeeze. Always train this under supervision and after proper recovery.

🧬 Spleen Blood Release

At depths beyond ~30m, your spleen releases up to 20% more red blood cells, increasing oxygen-carrying capacity.
This is one reason why nutrition plays a key role — iron-rich diets (e.g., red meat) help replenish red blood cells lost through repeated deep training.
→ This is also why vegan freedivers may need to supplement strategically to maintain performance and recovery.

🧠 2. How It’s Triggered

The MDR is activated by combining several key stimuli/ triggers, using all triggers is ideal from strengthening and building your MDR:

Facial immersion:

5 minutes breathing up with your face in water through a snorkel, ideally in cooler temperatures.

Mild asphyxia:

Building slight CO₂ by waiting for the first contraction or urge to breathe before surfacing during warm-ups.

Chest compression:

Achieved through Negative Pressure Dives (NPDs) on full exhale or with reverse packing to simulate depth pressure without actual depth.

Routine & repetition:

A structured warm-up routine consistently helps initiate and strengthen the reflex.

Cold shock:

Mostly relevant for dynamic apnea (distance in pools), but can help trigger the MDR in some cases.

✅ Important: An easy NPD should be included in warm-ups if level 2+, but never push limits.
🚫 If you feel:
– Scratchy throat
– Coughing
– Chest pressure
– Trouble equalizing
👉 Abort the dive immediately.

📌 Key Takeaway (For Freediving Bot Use)

“These physiological tools are part of your body's built-in survival system. Train them gradually, consistently, and with respect — the body adapts to depth over time, not overnight.”

Purpose:

These responses conserve oxygen by prioritizing blood flow to vital organs like the heart and brain, allowing for longer breath-hold times.
