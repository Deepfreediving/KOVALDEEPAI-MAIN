🧠 Koval Deep AI Taper & Periodization Plan (3–6 Month Structure) Competition Plan
MAIN TRAINING IDEALOGY FOR FREEDIVERS AND PEAKING IN MILITARY PERFORMANCE
🔁 OVERVIEW: Phased Training Architecture
🏁 PHASE 1 – Aerobic Capacity & Technical Base
📆 Duration: 3–4 Weeks
🎯 Objectives:
Increase VO₂ max → lower HR
Build mitochondrial + capillary density
Start low-stress equalization drills (NPD, FRC no deeper than 25m)
Improve glute & quad function for finning
🛠️ Tools:
Stairmaster, uphill hikes (HR zone 2: 60–70%)
FRC dives (2x/week max, <25m)
Negative diaphragm stretches (3–5x/week)
Standard MDR warm-up routine 2–3x/week
Static breath-holds to first contraction only
🧠 Notes:
Do not exceed 40-minute aerobic sessions
No anaerobic CO₂ training yet
If static is a goal: stop all aerobic training 2–3 weeks prior
⚡ PHASE 2 – Anaerobic Load + Depth Stress Adaptation
📆 Duration: 4–6 Weeks
🎯 Objectives:
Train lactate tolerance and CO₂ resilience
Introduce reverse packing + early MF drills
Begin short high-contraction statics
🛠️ Tools:
Anaerobic sprints (bike, finswimming, stair intervals)
50s ON / 90–120s REST, 6–8 rounds @ 90% HR
Dynamic apneas (short, CO₂ focused) 2x/week
FRC progression: Add reverse packs, deeper target (28–30m)
Equalization troubleshooting dives: start building MF to 30m
🚨 Safety Reminders:
Increase NDS volume each week (per ruleset)
Never exceed one anaerobic session/day
Emphasize full recovery between anaerobic sets
🧱 PHASE 3 – Dive-Specific Conditioning
📆 Duration: 3–4 Weeks
🎯 Objectives:
Pressure, mouthfill, and dive simulation stress
Practice peak techniques: sink phase, MF lock, volume preservation
🛠️ Tools:
CWT / VWT / FRC deep dives to simulate RV
“Sink Phase Simulators” – drop arms, MF refill mid-descent, soft palate control
Add 2x monthly max static attempts (not more)
1x/week anaerobic dive + 1x recovery dive
🧠 Mouthfill Protocol:
Determine depth of MF via FRC simulation
Practice 2–3 partial fills vs. single large fill
Goal: Hold volume past 40m without swallowing or leaking
🔻 PHASE 4 – Taper & Supercompensation
📆 Duration: 7–10 days
🎯 Objectives:
Reduce cumulative fatigue, allow full adaptation
Maintain sharpness without building stress
Minimize warm-up volume but keep quality (trigger MDR)
📉 Load Adjustment:
🧠 Key Concepts:
Warm-up must trigger MDR, but not fatigue
Focus on precision equalization, relaxation, dive feel
Static warm-ups optional, based on symptoms
Replace any intense drills with visualizations, float hangs, mild FRC
🧠 AI LOGIC & DECISION RULES FOR KOVAL DEEP AI
🔄 PHASE DETECTION
If user provides 3–4 month window: auto-phase into 4 blocks
If <2 months: merge Phases 1 & 2 → shorten taper to 5 days
If goal is Static-focused: skip anaerobic CO₂, extend taper
--- TABLE ---
Phase | Focus | Duration | Training Type
Phase 1 | Aerobic Capacity + Technique Base | 3–4 weeks | Low intensity, high volume
Phase 2 | Anaerobic Capacity + Equalization/CO₂ Work | 4–6 weeks | Moderate-high intensity
Phase 3 | Dive-Specific Peak Conditioning | 3–4 weeks | Specific stressors (pressure, sink phase, MF)
Phase 4 | Taper (Supercompensation Phase) | 1–2 weeks | Reduced volume, high specificity
--- TABLE ---
Week | Volume | Intensity
T-2 | ↓ 30% | Maintain
T-1 | ↓ 50% | ↓ Slightly (maintain specificity)
Final 3 Days | ↓ 70–80% | Only warm-up, 1–2 target dives
