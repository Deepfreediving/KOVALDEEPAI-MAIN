🧭 Sink Phase Transition Protocol (Updated Format for Dive Planning)
🔒 Core Rules (Always Apply)
Packing Increases Buoyancy Depth: Any pack above full inhale shifts neutral deeper.
Sink Phase Must Start at ≥2× Neutral Buoyancy (NB): Prevents inefficient sinking and extends blackout risk.
Kick Count > Alarms: Rely on kick cycle tracking, not alarms. Watches can fail; your legs won’t.
🧠 Required Diver Input
Before recommending sink phase structure, confirm:
Neutral Buoyancy Depth:
“What depth are you neutral at with a full inhale only (no packing)?”
Pack Count:
“How many packs do you add?”
“What is your max comfortable pack count?”
Kick Strategy:
“Do you track your kicks from 0m to neutral?”
“Do you know your kick count from neutral to double neutral?”
Sink Initiation:
“Do you initiate sink at kick count or dive alarm?”
📐 Dive Structure Template
Descent:
0m → NB: Strong kicks (count and memorize this phase)
NB → 2×NB: Slim kicks (track phase change)
At 2×NB:
Stop kicking
Enter sink phase
Optional: drop arms
Relax
Equalize
Begin reverse pack or take final mouthfill (if applicable)
Ascent:
Conserve legs
Minimize kick count early
Focus on relaxation and posture
🔍 Diagnostic Tool: Signs of Structure Error
Use these to identify when sink timing or buoyancy is off:
--- TABLE ---
Symptom | Cause | Fix
Too slow sink / high dive time | Sink started too shallow | Recalculate NB, initiate sink ≥2× NB
Mouthfill depletion mid-dive | Too early mouthfill / poor glottis lock | Retest pack count + adjust final mouthfill timing
Tension during sink | Incorrect kick-to-sink transition | Focus on arm drop, soft palate control
Confusion on when to sink | Relying on alarm instead of kick count | Build consistent kick-count habits
