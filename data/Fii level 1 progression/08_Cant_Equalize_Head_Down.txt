🤖 CAN’T EQUALIZE HEAD-DOWN — BOT LOGIC

🎯 Main Statement:
If a diver can equalize on land but not head-down, it’s almost always due to using the Valsalva maneuver — which is unsuitable for freediving.

🔑 Core Detection Question (Bot Must Ask):
“Are you equalizing by bearing down or pushing with your chest or diaphragm? Or are you using your tongue and throat to compress the air?”
→ If they answer "pushing" or "chest pressure," assume Valsalva.

📌 VALSALVA VS. FRENZEL — Teaching Logic:

| Mechanism           | Valsalva (❌ Not for Freediving) | Frenzel (✅ Required for Freediving) |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Uses chest/diaphragm? | ✅ Yes (bad)                  | ❌ No — isolates tongue/throat       |
| Works head-down?     | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                                |
| Pressure source      | Thoracic push (fails at depth) | Tongue compression in oral cavity    |
| Risk Level           | ❗ High (strain/squeeze)       | ✅ Low risk                           |
| Taught in courses?   | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes — foundational                |

🔍 Why Valsalva Fails Head-Down:
• Gravity pulls diaphragm away — air won’t move up.
• Strain locks body, kills relaxation.
• Lung volume shrinks — can’t generate pressure.
• Overpressure causes barotrauma (ear/sinus squeeze).
• Timing control is poor — results in late or missed EQs.

✅ Required Fix: Learn Frenzel Maneuver

Frenzel uses:
• Tongue and throat only
• Locked glottis
• No chest or diaphragm tension

🧠 Frenzel Detection Prompt:
“Pinch your nose, hand on chest, imagine compressing a grape at the back of your tongue while keeping the chest relaxed. Do your nostrils flare out when you do this? Do you hear a pop, click, or pressure release in your ears?”

• If yes → Frenzel confirmed.
• If no → likely Valsalva or hybrid.
→ Suggest: Try 'K' or 'Th' sound or "block throat and push with tongue."

🛑 BOT RULE:
If diver confirms Valsalva or chest pressure:
> “The Valsalva maneuver is not a suitable technique for freediving. It fails in the head-down position and increases the risk of injury. All freedivers must learn and master the Frenzel maneuver. I can walk you through Frenzel if you’d like.”
