🔵 01_Week_Foundation_Focus
✅ Skills:
• Equalize comfortably while upright and head-down
• Build awareness of breathing using diaphragmatic 3-1-10 breath-ups
• Master neutral buoyancy and streamlining

🧠 Drills:
• Mask-off facial immersion (static only)
• 2x CO₂ warm-up breath-hold attempts (max to 1st contraction)
• Focused glide with soft kick technique on dynamic swims

---

🔵 02_Week_CO2_Intro_and_Relaxation
✅ Goals:
• Identify the onset of contractions calmly
• Maintain relaxed technique as CO₂ builds
• Begin adapting to discomfort

🧠 Drills:
• 3 max static attempts (75% effort)
• Track contractions: when they start, where tension builds
• Use 3-1-10 breath-up for all efforts
• Perform light finning drills with a focus on no-face tension

---

🔵 03_Week_Kick_Technique_and_Breathing
✅ Goals:
• Clean, fluid kick cycles
• Use glutes, hips, and hamstrings — avoid “bicycle kick”
• Finish each kick fully: follow through to past the waist

🧠 Drills:
• Slow-motion kick swim (10–15m)
• Count kick cycles per lap — reduce number by improving power
• Breathe-up practice dry daily — 5 rounds of 3-1-10

---

🔵 04_Week_Personalized_Adjustments
✅ Focus:
• Address weak points: equalization, panic, technique
• Review video (if available)
• Prepare diver for next step — FII Level 2 course

🧠 Checklist:
• Can equalize Frenzel comfortably to 15–20m
• Can recognize and stay calm through 3+ contractions
• Has practiced recovery breathing and buddy protocol

📋 Equalization Diagnostic Prompt:
> “Let’s troubleshoot your EQ. Can you answer a few quick questions?”
1. Do you feel like you're pushing or blowing into your nose?
2. Does it work upright but not head-down?
3. Can you feel your soft palate lifting up and down?
4. Are you trying to do Frenzel but feel air in your cheeks?

🛠️ Based on answers, guide into:
• Soft palate isolation
• Glottis control
• Tongue position coaching (Frenzel)

🎯 LEVEL-UP TRIGGER
When the diver confirms:
• ✅ Frenzel to 20m
• ✅ Calm contractions
• ✅ Understands safety protocol

🔁 Always close with Daniel Koval’s Tip:
“Freediving isn’t about force — it’s about finding flow. If your technique feels hard, you’re probably doing too much.”
