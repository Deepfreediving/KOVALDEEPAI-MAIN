# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: User Authentication Flow

## Root Cause Analysis

After auditing the entire project against Wix best practices, the "👤 User • Widget" issue stems from **multiple authentication failures** in the message handling chain.

## Issues Found:

1. **❌ Wix Backend Not Deployed**: 500 errors indicate backend functions aren't live
2. **❌ Message Handling Gaps**: The `initialized` message from Wix isn't properly processed
3. **❌ Profile Data Not Extracted**: Even when userIds are received, profile data isn't used
4. **❌ Wrong Approach**: We're bypassing Wix's built-in member authentication

## Immediate Fixes Applied:

### 1. Fix Frontend User Authentication

- Updated message handling to properly process `initialized` messages
- Added support for profile data extraction from Wix backend
- Fixed security origins to include deepfreediving.com

### 2. Deploy Backend to Wix

The backend `userMemory.jsw` needs to be deployed to Wix Editor:

```javascript
// Copy this file content to Wix Editor -> Backend -> userMemory.jsw
// Then PUBLISH the site
```

### 3. Update Wix Frontend Integration

The Wix page needs to send proper user data:

```javascript
// In wix-frontend-page.js, ensure this sends real profile data:
aiWidget.postMessage({
  type: "initialized",
  data: {
    user: {
      id: member._id,
      profile: {
        displayName:
          member.profile?.nickname || member.profile?.firstName || "User",
        nickname: member.profile?.nickname,
        firstName: member.profile?.firstName,
        lastName: member.profile?.lastName,
        loginEmail: member.loginEmail,
        profilePhoto: member.profile?.profilePhoto,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy Backend**: Copy `userMemory.jsw` to Wix Editor and PUBLISH
2. **Test Authentication**: Check that user profile data flows through
3. **Verify Data Sync**: Ensure dive logs save to UserMemory dataset
4. **Test End-to-End**: Verify repeater shows dive logs

## Expected Results:

- ✅ User display shows real nickname from Members/FullData
- ✅ Dive logs save to Wix UserMemory dataset
- ✅ Logs appear in repeater with proper user filtering
- ✅ AI analysis works with user context

The system is production-ready once the backend is deployed to Wix.
