2. **Chat Integration** (`/api/openai/chat.ts`)
   - Modified to detect "yes" responses to audit offers
   - Routes audit requests to dedicated handler
   - Updated system prompt to offer audits appropriately

3. **Audit Request Handler** (`/api/chat/audit-request.js`)

   - Formats E.N.C.L.O.S.E. results for chat display
   - Provides structured feedback with scores and recommendations

### E.N.C.L.O.S.E. Framework Breakdown

**E** - **Equalization Issues**

- Detects: Ear squeeze, EQ failures, mouthfill problems
- Severity: 0-3 (none, mild, moderate, critical)
- Drills: Dry EQ practice, Valsalva to Frenzel transition, mouthfill progression

**N** - **Narcosis** (Depth >35m)

- Detects: Reported narcosis symptoms at depth
- Triggers: Narcosis level â‰¥2 at depths >35m
- Drills: COâ‚‚/Oâ‚‚ recalibration, depth progression halt

**C** - **COâ‚‚ Tolerance / Early Contractions**

- Detects: Early contractions, urge to breathe, panic responses
- Triggers: Keywords in comments, early turn exits
- Drills: COâ‚‚ tables (max 2x/week), visualization training, static hangs

**L** - **Leg Fatigue / Finning Issues**

- Detects: Leg fatigue, poor finning technique, slow descent
- Triggers: Comments about legs/fins, descent speed <0.8 m/s at depth >40m
- Drills: Finning technique practice, glute strengthening, kick cycle adjustment

**O** - **Oxygen Management / Recovery**

- Detects: LMC, blackout, poor recovery quality, lung squeeze
- Critical triggers: Any Oâ‚‚ depletion signs
- Drills: Oâ‚‚ Protocol (2.5min ON/1min OFF), recovery breathing, extended surface intervals

**S** - **Squeeze Risk**

- Detects: Lung squeeze, ear squeeze, sinus issues
- Severity based on squeeze type and recurrence
- Drills: Thoracic squeeze prevention, NPD practice, dry EQ drills

**E2** - **Equipment Issues**

- Detects: Mask leaks, gear problems, equipment malfunctions
- Generally lower severity but affects performance
- Drills: Equipment fitting checks, streamlining review

### Scoring System

**Individual Scores (0-5):**

- **Safety**: Inverse of total severity across all categories
- **Technique**: Based on speed metrics and form
- **Efficiency**: Depth-to-time ratio performance
- **Readiness**: Training vs. PB vs. competition attempt assessment

**Final Score**: Weighted average prioritizing safety

### Database Schema

**Enhanced `dive_log_audit` table:**

```sql
criteria_version    text        -- 'koval_enclose_v1'
model              text        -- AI model used
score_final        numeric     -- Weighted final score
score_safety       smallint    -- Safety subscore
score_technique    smallint    -- Technique subscore
score_efficiency   smallint    -- Efficiency subscore
score_readiness    smallint    -- Readiness subscore
enclose           jsonb       -- E.N.C.L.O.S.E. category array
```

**Views for Analysis:**

- `v_dive_metrics`: Computed speeds and VDI metrics
- `v_user_enclose_summary`: Aggregated E.N.C.L.O.S.E. stats per user

## ðŸ”„ User Experience Flow

1. **Koval AI Offers Audit**: When discussing dive issues or patterns
   - "Do you want me to do a dive journal evaluation of patterns or issues that can be causing your problems for a more technical and in-depth evaluation? Just respond with 'yes' if you'd like me to proceed."

2. **User Consents**: Responds with "yes" (various forms accepted)

3. **Audit Execution**:
   - Fetches most recent dive log
   - Applies E.N.C.L.O.S.E. framework analysis
   - Computes derived metrics (speeds, VDI)
   - Generates structured evaluation

4. **Results Display**:
   - Performance scores breakdown
   - Specific E.N.C.L.O.S.E. category issues identified
   - Targeted drill recommendations
   - Technical metrics summary

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements (Based on ChatGPT Recommendations)

### Batch Processing Capability

- **Bulk Audit API**: Process 10-100+ dives at once
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues across sessions
- **Trend Analysis**: Track score improvements over time
- **Automated Drill Prescription**: Union of top E.N.C.L.O.S.E. issues

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Audit Dashboard**: Heatmap of E.N.C.L.O.S.E. severities
- **Progress Tracking**: Score trend lines and improvement metrics
- **One-Click Re-audit**: Button to re-evaluate with updated criteria
