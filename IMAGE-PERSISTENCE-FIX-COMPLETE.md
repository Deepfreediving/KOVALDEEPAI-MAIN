# 🎯 IMAGE PERSISTENCE FIX - COMPLETE

## Problem

When editing a saved dive log, **the uploaded dive computer image was not appearing** in the edit form. Users had to re-upload the image every time they wanted to edit a dive log, losing the original analysis data.

## Root Cause

The image data **was being saved correctly** to the database in the `ai_analysis` JSONB field, but when loading the dive log for editing, the code was only looking for image data in the wrong places:

```javascript
// ❌ OLD CODE - only checked top-level fields
imagePreview: log.imageUrl || log.image_url || null;
```

The image URL was actually stored in:

```javascript
log.ai_analysis.imageUrl; // ✅ Actual location
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Field Mapping in DiveJournalDisplay.jsx

**File**: `/apps/web/components/DiveJournalDisplay.jsx`  
**Lines**: 133-136

```javascript
// ✅ FIXED - now checks ai_analysis field
imagePreview: log.imageUrl || log.image_url || log.ai_analysis?.imageUrl || null,
diveComputerFileName: log.ai_analysis?.diveComputerFileName || "",
```

### 2. How Image Data is Stored

When a dive log is saved, image data is stored in the `ai_analysis` JSONB field:

```javascript
ai_analysis: {
  imageUrl: "https://supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/dive-images/user-id/image.jpg",
  imageId: "unique-image-id",
  diveComputerFileName: "110m_pb.jpg",
  extractedMetrics: { max_depth: 108.7, dive_time_formatted: "02:53", ... },
  imageAnalysis: { confidence: 0.95, ... }
}
```

### 3. Edit Mode Flow Now Working

1. **Upload & Save**: Image uploaded → analyzed → saved with dive log in `ai_analysis` field
2. **Edit Later**: Load dive log → extract image URL from `ai_analysis.imageUrl` → display in form
3. **Re-analyze Available**: Image still accessible for re-analysis if needed

## Testing Results

✅ **New Format Support**: Correctly loads images from `ai_analysis.imageUrl`  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports old format (`imageUrl`, `image_url`)  
✅ **Form Field Mapping**: All fields populate correctly (mouthfill depth, time format, etc.)  
✅ **Image Preview**: Dive computer images now appear in edit mode  
✅ **Filename Preservation**: Original filename maintained for user reference

## What This Fixes for Users

### Before Fix:

1. Upload dive computer image → Gets analyzed ✅
2. Save dive log with analysis ✅
3. Edit saved dive log → **Image gone** ❌
4. Have to re-upload same image ❌

### After Fix:

1. Upload dive computer image → Gets analyzed ✅
2. Save dive log with analysis ✅
3. Edit saved dive log → **Image still there** ✅
4. Can modify other fields without losing image ✅

## Implementation Details

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintains backward compatibility with old dive logs
- **Efficient**: No additional database queries needed
- **Robust**: Handles multiple fallback scenarios for image URL
- **Future-Proof**: Works with the existing save/load architecture

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/apps/web/components/DiveJournalDisplay.jsx` - Fixed field mapping
- ✅ Test files created to verify functionality

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The image persistence issue is now resolved. Users can edit their saved dive logs without losing the uploaded dive computer images or analysis data.
