# ðŸ”§ WIX BACKEND DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## Current Status: MODULE_LOAD_ERROR on all functions

This error typically means one of the following issues:

### 1. FILE STRUCTURE ISSUE

Ensure files are in the exact correct locations in Wix:

**Correct structure in Wix Editor:**

```
Backend
â”œâ”€â”€ http-functions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-testBackend.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-simpleTest.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-independentTest.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-saveDiveLog.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-diveLogs.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-getUserProfile.jsw
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http-chat.jsw
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ http-userMemory.jsw
â””â”€â”€ wix-utils.jsw
```

### 2. IMPORT/EXPORT SYNTAX ISSUE

The issue might be ES6 import syntax. Try this simpler version:

**For wix-utils.jsw - SIMPLE VERSION:**

```javascript
// No imports, just exports
export const WIX_CONFIG = {
  COLLECTIONS: {
    MEMBERS: "Members/FullData",
    DIVE_LOGS: "DiveLogs",
  },
};
```

### 3. DEPLOYMENT STEPS TO TRY

**Option A: Manual Upload**

1. In Wix Editor, go to Code â†’ Backend
2. Delete any existing files with same names
3. Create new files one by one
4. Copy-paste content directly
5. Save each file
6. Publish site

**Option B: Test Functions Only**

1. Deploy ONLY the simple test functions first:
   - http-simpleTest.jsw
   - http-independentTest.jsw
2. Test these work before adding complex functions
3. If they work, add others one by one

### 4. COMMON WIXCODE ISSUES

**Issue: ES6 Import Problems**

- Wix might not support all ES6 syntax
- Try CommonJS: `const { wixData } = require('wix-data');`

**Issue: Async/Await**

- Some Wix versions have issues with async/await
- Try Promise-based approaches instead

**Issue: File Names**

- Must start with `http-` for HTTP functions
- Must have `.jsw` extension
- Function names must match file names

### 5. QUICK TEST COMMANDS

After deploying simpler functions, test with:

```bash
# Test simple function
curl -X POST "https://www.deepfreediving.com/_functions/simpleTest"

# Test independent function
curl -X POST "https://www.deepfreediving.com/_functions/independentTest"
```

### 6. DEBUGGING STEPS

1. **Deploy minimal functions first** (no imports)
2. **Test each function individually**
3. **Add complexity gradually**
4. **Check Wix Editor console for errors**
5. **Verify file paths are exactly correct**

### 7. FALLBACK SOLUTION

If backend functions continue to fail, we can:

1. Use only Vercel backend for now
2. Save dive logs to localStorage + periodic sync
3. Handle image uploads through Vercel only
4. Fix Wix backend issues separately

This would allow the system to work while debugging Wix deployment issues.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Try deploying **http-simpleTest.jsw** only
2. Test if it returns 200 status
3. If it works, add other functions one by one
4. If it doesn't work, the issue is with Wix deployment process itself
